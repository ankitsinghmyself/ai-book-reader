["REAL NUMBERS 1\n1\nR N\nEAL UMBERS\n1.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you began your exploration of the world of real numbers and encountered\nirrational numbers. We continue our discussion on real numbers in this chapter. We\nbegin with very important properties of positive integers in Sections 1.2, namely the\nEuclid’s division algorithm and the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Euclid’s division algorithm, as the name suggests, has to do with divisibility of\nintegers. Stated simply, it says any positive integer a can be divided by another positive\ninteger b in such a way that it leaves a remainder r that is smaller than b. Many of you\nprobably recognise this as the usual long division process. Although this result is quite\neasy to state and understand, it has many applications related to the divisibility properties\nof integers. We touch upon a few of them, and use it mainly to compute the HCF of\ntwo positive integers. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, on the other hand, has to do something\nwith multiplication of positive integers. You already know that every composite number\ncan be expressed as a product of primes in a unique way—this important fact is the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Again, while it is a result that is easy to state and\nunderstand, it has some very deep and significant applications in the field of mathematics. We use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic for two main applications. First, we\nuse it to prove the irrationality of many of the numbers you studied in Class IX, such as\n2, 3 and 5. Second, we apply this theorem to explore when exactly the decimal\np\nexpansion of a rational number, say (q  0), is terminating and when it is non-\nq\nterminating repeating. We do so by looking at the prime factorisation of the denominator\np\nq of . You will see that the prime factorisation of q will completely reveal the nature\nq\np\nof the decimal expansion of . q\nSo let us begin our exploration. Reprint 2025-26\n2 MATHEMATICS\n1.2 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic\nIn your earlier classes, you have seen that any natural number can be written as a\nproduct of its prime factors. For instance, 2 = 2, 4 = 2 × 2, 253 = 11 × 23, and so on. Now, let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction. That is, can any\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers? Let us see. Take any collection of prime numbers, say 2, 3, 7, 11 and 23. If we multiply\nsome or all of these numbers, allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish,\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers (In fact, infinitely many). Let us list a few :\n7 × 11 × 23 = 1771 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 5313\n2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 10626 23 × 3 × 73 = 8232\n22 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23 = 21252\nand so on. Now, let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes. What is your guess about the size of this collection? Does it contain only a finite\nnumber of integers, or infinitely many? Infact, there are infinitely many primes.", "So,\nif we combine all these primes in all possible ways, we will get an infinite\ncollection of numbers, all\nthe primes and all possible\nproducts of primes. The\nquestion is – can we\nproduce all the composite\nnumbers this way? What\ndo you think? Do you\nthink that there may be a\ncomposite number which\nis not the product of\npowers of primes? Before we answer this,\nlet us factorise positive\nintegers, that is, do the\nopposite of what we have\ndone so far. We are going to use\nthe factor tree with which\nyou are all familiar. Let us\ntake some large number,\nsay, 32760, and factorise\nit as shown. Reprint 2025-26\nREAL NUMBERS 3\nSo we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of\nprimes, i.e., 32760 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes. Let us try\nanother number, say, 123456789. This can be written as 32 × 3803 × 3607. Of course,\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes! (Try it out for several other natural\nnumbers yourself.) This leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\nwritten as the product of powers of primes. In fact, this statement is true, and is called\nthe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\nto the study of integers. Let us now formally state this theorem. Theorem 1.1 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) : Every composite\nnumber can be expressed (factorised) as a product of primes, and this factorisation\nis unique, apart from the order in which the prime factors occur. An equivalent version of Theorem 1.2 was probably\nfirst recorded as Proposition 14 of Book IX in Euclid’s\nElements, before it came to be known as the\nFundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. However, the\nfirst correct proof was given by Carl Friedrich Gauss\nin his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae. Carl Friedrich Gauss is often referred to as the ‘Prince\nof Mathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\ngreatest mathematicians of all time, along with\nArchimedes and Newton. He has made fundamental Carl Friedrich Gauss\ncontributions to both mathematics and science. (1777 – 1855)\nThe Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that every composite number can\nbe factorised as a product of primes. Actually it says more. It says that given any\ncomposite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a ‘unique’\nway, except for the order in which the primes occur. That is, given any composite\nnumber there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes, as long as we\nare not particular about the order in which the primes occur. So, for example, we\nregard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2, or any other possible order in which\nthese primes are written. This fact is also stated in the following form:\nThe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique, except for the order\nof its factors. Reprint 2025-26\n4 MATHEMATICS\nIn general, given a composite number x, we factorise it as x = p p ...", "p , where\n1 2 n\np , p ,..., p are primes and written in ascending order, i.e., p  p\n1 2 n 1 2\n . . .  p . If we combine the same primes, we will get powers of primes. For example,\nn\n32760 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 = 23 × 32 × 5 × 7 × 13\nOnce we have decided that the order will be ascending, then the way the number\nis factorised, is unique. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic has many applications, both within\nmathematics and in other fields. Let us look at some examples. Example 1 : Consider the numbers 4n, where n is a natural number. Check whether\nthere is any value of n for which 4n ends with the digit zero. Solution : If the number 4n, for any n, were to end with the digit zero, then it would be\ndivisible by 5. That is, the prime factorisation of 4n would contain the prime 5. This is\nnot possible because 4n = (2)2n; so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n is 2. So, the\nuniqueness of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic guarantees that there are no\nother primes in the factorisation of 4n. So, there is no natural number n for which 4n\nends with the digit zero. You have already learnt how to find the HCF and LCM of two positive integers\nusing the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic in earlier classes, without realising it! This method is also called the prime factorisation method. Let us recall this method\nthrough an example. Example 2 : Find the LCM and HCF of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method. Solution : We have : 6 = 21 × 31 and 20 = 2 × 2 × 5 = 22 × 51. You can find HCF(6, 20) = 2 and LCM(6, 20) = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 60, as done in your\nearlier classes. Note that HCF(6, 20) = 21 = Product of the smallest power of each common\nprime factor in the numbers. LCM (6, 20) = 22 × 31 × 51 =Product of the greatest power of each prime factor,\ninvolved in the numbers. From the example above, you might have noticed that HCF(6, 20) × LCM(6, 20)\n= 6 × 20. In fact, we can verify that for any two positive integers a and b,\nHCF (a, b) × LCM (a, b) = a × b. We can use this result to find the LCM of two\npositive integers, if we have already found the HCF of the two positive integers. Example 3: Find the HCF of 96 and 404 by the prime factorisation method. Hence,\nfind their LCM. Reprint 2025-26\nREAL NUMBERS 5\nSolution : The prime factorisation of 96 and 404 gives :\n96 = 25 × 3, 404 = 22 × 101\nTherefore, the HCF of these two integers is 22 = 4. 96404 96404\nAlso, LCM (96, 404) =  9696\nHCF(96, 404) 4\nExample 4 : Find the HCF and LCM of 6, 72 and 120, using the prime factorisation\nmethod. Solution : We have :\n6 = 2 × 3, 72 = 23 × 32, 120 = 23 × 3 × 5\nHere, 21 and 31 are the smallest powers of the common factors 2 and 3, respectively. So, HCF (6, 72, 120) = 21 × 31 = 2 × 3 = 6\n23, 32 and 51 are the greatest powers of the prime factors 2, 3 and 5 respectively\ninvolved in the three numbers. So, LCM (6, 72, 120) = 23 × 32 × 51 = 360\nRemark : Notice, 6 × 72 × 120  HCF (6, 72, 120) × LCM (6, 72, 120).", "So, the\nproduct of three numbers is not equal to the product of their HCF and LCM.

After how many minutes\nwill they meet again at the starting point? 1.3 Revisiting Irrational Numbers\nIn Class IX, you were introduced to irrational numbers and many of their properties. You studied about their existence and how the rationals and the irrationals together\nmade up the real numbers. You even studied how to locate irrationals on the number\nline. However, we did not prove that they were irrationals. In this section, we will\nprove that 2, 3, 5 and, in general, p is irrational, where p is a prime. One of\nthe theorems, we use in our proof, is the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. p\nRecall, a number ‘s’ is called irrational if it cannot be written in the form ,\nq\nwhere p and q are integers and q „ 0. Some examples of irrational numbers, with\nwhich you are already familiar, are :\n2\n2, 3, 15, , ,0.10110111011110..., etc. 3\nBefore we prove that 2 is irrational, we need the following theorem, whose\nproof is based on the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Theorem 1.2 : Let p be a prime number. If p divides a2, then p divides a, where\na is a positive integer. *Proof : Let the prime factorisation of a be as follows :\na = p p . . . p , where p ,p , . . ., p are primes, not necessarily distinct. 1 2 n 1 2 n\nTherefore, a2 = (p p . . . p )(p p . . . p ) = p2p2 . . . p2. 1 2 n 1 2 n 1 2 n\nNow, we are given that p divides a2. Therefore, from the Fundamental Theorem of\nArithmetic, it follows that p is one of the prime factors of a2. However, using the\nuniqueness part of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, we realise that the only\nprime factors of a2 are p , p , . . ., p . So p is one of p , p , . . ., p . 1 2 n 1 2 n\nNow, since a = p p . . . p , p divides a. 1 2 n\nWe are now ready to give a proof that 2 is irrational. The proof is based on a technique called ‘proof by contradiction’. (This technique is\ndiscussed in some detail in Appendix 1). Theorem 1.3 : 2 is irrational. Proof : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 2 is rational.", "* Not from the examination point of view. Reprint 2025-26\nREAL NUMBERS 7\nr\nSo, we can find integers r and s („ 0) such that 2 = . s\nSuppose r and s have a common factor other than 1. Then, we divide by the common\na\nfactor to get 2  , where a and b are coprime. b\nSo, b 2 = a. Squaring on both sides and rearranging, we get 2b2 = a2. Therefore, 2 divides a2. Now, by Theorem 1.2, it follows that 2 divides a. So, we can write a = 2c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 2b2 = 4c2, that is, b2 = 2c2. This means that 2 divides b2, and so 2 divides b (again using Theorem 1.2 with p = 2). Therefore, a and b have at least 2 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b have no common factors other than 1. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 2 is rational. So, we conclude that 2 is irrational. Example 5 : Prove that 3 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3 is rational. a\nThat is, we can find integers a and b („ 0) such that 3 = \nb\nSuppose a and b have a common factor other than 1, then we can divide by the\ncommon factor, and assume that a and b are coprime. So, b 3  a\nSquaring on both sides, and rearranging, we get 3b2 = a2. Therefore, a2 is divisible by 3, and by Theorem 1.2, it follows that a is also divisible\nby 3. So, we can write a = 3c for some integer c. Substituting for a, we get 3b2 = 9c2, that is, b2 = 3c2. This means that b2 is divisible by 3, and so b is also divisible by 3 (using Theorem 1.2\nwith p = 3). Reprint 2025-26\n8 MATHEMATICS\nTherefore, a and b have at least 3 as a common factor. But this contradicts the fact that a and b are coprime. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 3 is rational. So, we conclude that 3 is irrational. In Class IX, we mentioned that :\n the sum or difference of a rational and an irrational number is irrational and\n the product and quotient of a non-zero rational and irrational number is\nirrational. We prove some particular cases here. Example 6 : Show that 5 – 3 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 5 – 3 is rational. a\nThat is, we can find coprime a and b (b  0) such that 5 3  \nb\na\nTherefore, 5  3\nb\na 5b  a\nRearranging this equation, we get 3 5 –  \nb b\na\nSince a and b are integers, we get 5 – is rational, and so 3 is rational. b\nBut this contradicts the fact that 3 is irrational. This contradiction has arisen because of our incorrect assumption that 5 – 3 is\nrational. So, we conclude that 5 3 is irrational. Example 7 : Show that 3 2 is irrational. Solution : Let us assume, to the contrary, that 3 2 is rational. a\nThat is, we can find coprime a and b (b  0) such that 3 2  \nb\na\nRearranging, we get 2  \n3b\na\nSince 3, a and b are integers, is rational, and so 2 is rational. 3b\nReprint 2025-26\nREAL NUMBERS 9\nBut this contradicts the fact that 2 is irrational. So, we conclude that 3 2 is irrational. EXERCISE 1.2\n1. Prove that 5 is irrational. 2.", "Prove that 3 2 5 is irrational. 3.
