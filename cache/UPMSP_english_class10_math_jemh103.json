She wanted to enjoy rides on the Giant Wheel\nand play Hoopla (a game in which you throw a ring on the items kept in a stall, and if\nthe ring covers any object completely, you get it). The number of times she played\nHoopla is half the number of rides she had on the Giant Wheel. If each ride costs\n` 3, and a game of Hoopla costs ` 4, how would you find out the number of rides she\nhad and how many times she played Hoopla, provided she spent ` 20. May be you will try it by considering different cases. If she has one ride, is it\npossible? Is it possible to have two rides? And so on. Or you may use the knowledge\nof Class IX, to represent such situations as linear equations in two variables. Reprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 25\nLet us try this approach. Denote the number of rides that Akhila had by x, and the number of times she\nplayed Hoopla by y. Now the situation can be represented by the two equations:\n1\ny = x (1)\n2\n3x + 4y = 20 (2)\nCan we find the solutions of this pair of equations? There are several ways of\nfinding these, which we will study in this chapter. 3.2 Graphical Method of Solution of a Pair of Linear Equations\nA pair of linear equations which has no solution, is called an inconsistent pair of linear\nequations. A pair of linear equations in two variables, which has a solution, is called a\nconsistent pair of linear equations. A pair of linear equations which are equivalent has\ninfinitely many distinct common solutions. Such a pair is called a dependent pair of\nlinear equations in two variables. Note that a dependent pair of linear equations is\nalways consistent. We can now summarise the behaviour of lines representing a pair of linear equations\nin two variables and the existence of solutions as follows:\n(i) the lines may intersect in a single point. In this case, the pair of equations\nhas a unique solution (consistent pair of equations). (ii) the lines may be parallel. In this case, the equations have no solution\n(inconsistent pair of equations). (iii) the lines may be coincident. In this case, the equations have infinitely many\nsolutions [dependent (consistent) pair of equations]. Consider the following three pairs of equations. (i) x – 2y = 0 and 3x + 4y – 20 = 0 (The lines intersect)\n(ii) 2x + 3y – 9 = 0 and 4x + 6y – 18 = 0 (The lines coincide)\n(iii) x + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (The lines are parallel)\na b c\nLet us now write down, and compare, the values of 1 , 1 and 1 in all the\na b c\n2 2 2\nthree examples.

You can verify them by\nconsidering some more examples by yourself. Let us now consider some more examples to illustrate it. Example 1 : Check graphically whether the pair of equations\nx + 3y = 6 (1)\nand 2x – 3y = 12 (2)\nis consistent. If so, solve them graphically. Solution : Let us draw the graphs of the Equations (1) and (2). For this, we find two\nsolutions of each of the equations, which are given in Table 3.2\nReprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 27\nTable 3.2\nx 0 6 x 0 3\n6 − x 2x −12\ny = 2 0 y = –4 –2\n3 3\nPlot the points A(0, 2), B(6, 0),\nP(0, – 4) and Q(3, – 2) on graph\npaper, and join the points to form the\nlines AB and PQ as shown in\nFig. 3.1. We observe that there is a point\nB (6, 0) common to both the lines\nAB and PQ. So, the solution of the\npair of linear equations is x = 6 and\ny = 0, i.e., the given pair of equations\nis consistent. Fig. 3.1\nExample 2 : Graphically, find whether the following pair of equations has no solution,\nunique solution or infinitely many solutions:\n5x – 8y + 1 = 0 (1)\n24 3\n3x – y + = 0 (2)\n5 5\n5\n,\nSolution : Multiplying Equation (2) by we get\n3\n5x – 8y + 1 = 0\nBut, this is the same as Equation (1). Hence the lines represented by Equations (1)\nand (2) are coincident. Therefore, Equations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. Plot few points on the graph and verify it yourself. Example 3 : Champa went to a ‘Sale’ to purchase some pants and skirts. When her\nfriends asked her how many of each she had bought, she answered, “The number of\nskirts is two less than twice the number of pants purchased. Also, the number of skirts\nis four less than four times the number of pants purchased”. Help her friends to find\nhow many pants and skirts Champa bought. Reprint 2025-26\n28 MATHEMATICS\nSolution : Let us denote the number of pants by x and the number of skirts by y. Then\nthe equations formed are :\ny = 2x – 2 (1)\nand y = 4x – 4 (2)\nLet us draw the graphs of\nEquations (1) and (2) by finding two\nsolutions for each of the equations.

Reprint 2025-26\n30 MATHEMATICS\n3.3 Algebraic Methods of Solving a Pair of Linear Equations\nIn the previous section, we discussed how to solve a pair of linear equations graphically. The graphical method is not convenient in cases when the point representing the\n( )\nsolution of the linear equations has non-integral coordinates like 3, 2 7 ,\n 4 1 \n,\n(–1.75, 3.3),  , etc. There is every possibility of making mistakes while reading\n13 19\nsuch coordinates. Is there any alternative method of finding the solution? There are\nseveral algebraic methods, which we shall now discuss. 3.3.1 Substitution Method : We shall explain the method of substitution by taking\nsome examples.", "Example 4 : Solve the following pair of equations by substitution method:\n7x – 15y = 2 (1)\nx + 2y = 3 (2)\nSolution :\nStep 1 : We pick either of the equations and write one variable in terms of the other. Let us consider the Equation (2) :\nx + 2y = 3\nand write it as x = 3 – 2y (3)\nStep 2 : Substitute the value of x in Equation (1). We get\n7(3 – 2y) – 15y = 2\ni.e., 21 – 14y – 15y = 2\ni.e., –29y = –19\n19\nTherefore, y =\n29\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of y in Equation (3), we get\n19 49\nx = 3 – 2  =\n29 29\n49 19\nTherefore, the solution is x = , y = . 29 29\nReprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 31\n49 19\nVerification : Substituting x = and y = , you can verify that both the Equations\n29 29\n(1) and (2) are satisfied. To understand the substitution method more clearly, let us consider it stepwise:\nStep 1 : Find the value of one variable, say y in terms of the other variable, i.e., x from\neither equation, whichever is convenient. Step 2 : Substitute this value of y in the other equation, and reduce it to an equation in\none variable, i.e., in terms of x, which can be solved. Sometimes, as in Examples 9 and\n10 below, you can get statements with no variable. If this statement is true, you can\nconclude that the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. If the statement\nis false, then the pair of linear equations is inconsistent. Step 3 : Substitute the value of x (or y) obtained in Step 2 in the equation used in\nStep 1 to obtain the value of the other variable. Remark : We have substituted the value of one variable by expressing it in terms of\nthe other variable to solve the pair of linear equations. That is why the method is\nknown as the substitution method. Example 5 : Solve the following question—Aftab tells his daughter, “Seven years\nago, I was seven times as old as you were then. Also, three years from now, I shall be\nthree times as old as you will be.” (Isn’t this interesting?) Represent this situation\nalgebraically and graphically by the method of substitution. Solution : Let s and t be the ages (in years) of Aftab and his daughter, respectively. Then, the pair of linear equations that represent the situation is\ns – 7 = 7 (t – 7), i.e., s – 7t + 42 = 0 (1)\nand s + 3 = 3 (t + 3), i.e., s – 3t = 6 (2)\nUsing Equation (2), we get s = 3t + 6. Putting this value of s in Equation (1), we get\n(3t + 6) – 7t + 42 = 0,\ni.e., 4t = 48, which gives t = 12. Putting this value of t in Equation (2), we get\ns = 3 (12) + 6 = 42\nReprint 2025-26\n32 MATHEMATICS\nSo, Aftab and his daughter are 42 and 12 years old, respectively. Verify this answer by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the given problems. Example 6 : In a shop the cost of 2 pencils and 3 erasers is `9 and the cost of 4\npencils and 6 erasers is `18. Find the cost of each pencil and each eraser.", "Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:\n2x + 3y = 9 (1)\n4x + 6y = 18 (2)\nWe first express the value of x in terms of y from the equation 2x + 3y = 9, to get\n9−3y\nx = (3)\n2\nNow we substitute this value of x in Equation (2), to get\n4(9−3y)\n+ 6y = 18\n2\ni.e., 18 – 6y + 6y = 18\ni.e., 18 = 18\nThis statement is true for all values of y. However, we do not get a specific\nvalue of y as a solution. Therefore, we cannot obtain a specific value of x. This\nsituation has arisen because both the given equations are the same. Therefore,\nEquations (1) and (2) have infinitely many solutions. We cannot find a unique\ncost of a pencil and an eraser, because there are many common solutions, to the\ngiven situation. Example 7 : Two rails are represented by the equations\nx + 2y – 4 = 0 and 2x + 4y – 12 = 0. Will the rails cross each other? Solution : The pair of linear equations formed were:\nx + 2y – 4 = 0 (1)\n2x + 4y – 12 = 0 (2)\nWe express x in terms of y from Equation (1) to get\nx = 4 – 2y\nNow, we substitute this value of x in Equation (2) to get\n2(4 – 2y) + 4y – 12 = 0\nReprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 33\ni.e., 8 – 12 = 0\ni.e., – 4 = 0\nwhich is a false statement. Therefore, the equations do not have a common solution. So, the two rails will not\ncross each other. EXERCISE 3.2\n1. Solve the following pair of linear equations by the substitution method.

What are their present ages? 3.3.2 Elimination Method\nNow let us consider another method of eliminating (i.e., removing) one variable.", "This\nis sometimes more convenient than the substitution method. Let us see how this method\nworks. Example 8 : The ratio of incomes of two persons is 9 : 7 and the ratio of their\nexpenditures is 4 : 3. If each of them manages to save ` 2000 per month, find their\nmonthly incomes. Solution : Let us denote the incomes of the two person by ` 9x and ` 7x and their\nexpenditures by ` 4y and ` 3y respectively. Then the equations formed in the situation\nis given by :\n9x – 4y = 2000 (1)\nand 7x – 3y = 2000 (2)\nStep 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 3 and Equation (2) by 4 to make the coefficients of\ny equal. Then we get the equations:\n27x – 12y = 6000 (3)\n28x – 12y = 8000 (4)\nStep 2 : Subtract Equation (3) from Equation (4) to eliminate y, because the coefficients\nof y are the same. So, we get\n(28x – 27x) – (12y – 12y) = 8000 – 6000\ni.e., x = 2000\nStep 3 : Substituting this value of x in (1), we get\n9(2000) – 4y = 2000\ni.e., y = 4000\nSo, the solution of the equations is x = 2000, y = 4000. Therefore, the monthly incomes\nof the persons are ` 18,000 and ` 14,000, respectively. Verification : 18000 : 14000 = 9 : 7. Also, the ratio of their expenditures =\n18000 – 2000 : 14000 – 2000 = 16000 : 12000 = 4 : 3\nRemarks :\n1. The method used in solving the example above is called the elimination method,\nbecause we eliminate one variable first, to get a linear equation in one variable. Reprint 2025-26\nPAIR OF LINEAR EQUATIONS IN TWO VARIABLES 35\nIn the example above, we eliminated y. We could also have eliminated x. Try\ndoing it that way. 2. You could also have used the substitution, or graphical method, to solve this\nproblem. Try doing so, and see which method is more convenient. Let us now note down these steps in the elimination method :\nStep 1 : First multiply both the equations by some suitable non-zero constants to make\nthe coefficients of one variable (either x or y) numerically equal. Step 2 : Then add or subtract one equation from the other so that one variable gets\neliminated. If you get an equation in one variable, go to Step 3. If in Step 2, we obtain a true statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has infinitely many solutions. If in Step 2, we obtain a false statement involving no variable, then the original\npair of equations has no solution, i.e., it is inconsistent. Step 3 : Solve the equation in one variable (x or y) so obtained to get its value. Step 4 : Substitute this value of x (or y) in either of the original equations to get the\nvalue of the other variable. Now to illustrate it, we shall solve few more examples. Example 9 : Use elimination method to find all possible solutions of the following pair\nof linear equations :\n2x + 3y = 8 (1)\n4x + 6y = 7 (2)\nSolution :\nStep 1 : Multiply Equation (1) by 2 and Equation (2) by 1 to make the\ncoefficients of x equal.", "Then we get the equations as :\n4x + 6y = 16 (3)\n4x + 6y = 7 (4)\nStep 2 : Subtracting Equation (4) from Equation (3),\n(4x – 4x) + (6y – 6y) = 16 – 7\ni.e., 0 = 9, which is a false statement. Therefore, the pair of equations has no solution. Example 10 : The sum of a two-digit number and the number obtained by reversing\nthe digits is 66. If the digits of the number differ by 2, find the number. How many such\nnumbers are there? Reprint 2025-26\n36 MATHEMATICS\nSolution : Let the ten’s and the unit’s digits in the first number be x and y, respectively. So, the first number may be written as 10x + y in the expanded form (for example,\n56 = 10(5) + 6). When the digits are reversed, x becomes the unit’s digit and y becomes the ten’s\ndigit. This number, in the expanded notation is 10y + x (for example, when 56 is\nreversed, we get 65 = 10(6) + 5). According to the given condition. (10x + y) + (10y + x) = 66\ni.e., 11(x + y) = 66\ni.e., x + y = 6 (1)\nWe are also given that the digits differ by 2, therefore,\neither x – y = 2 (2)\nor y – x = 2 (3)\nIf x – y = 2, then solving (1) and (2) by elimination, we get x = 4 and y = 2. In this case, we get the number 42. If y – x = 2, then solving (1) and (3) by elimination, we get x = 2 and y = 4. In this case, we get the number 24. Thus, there are two such numbers 42 and 24. Verification : Here 42 + 24 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. Also 24 + 42 = 66 and 4 – 2 = 2. EXERCISE 3.3\n1.
