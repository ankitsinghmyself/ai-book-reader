["ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 49\n5\nA P\nRITHMETIC ROGRESSIONS\n5.1 Introduction\nYou must have observed that in nature, many things follow a certain pattern, such as\nthe petals of a sunflower, the holes of a honeycomb, the grains on a maize cob, the\nspirals on a pineapple and on a pine cone, etc. We now look for some patterns which occur in our day-to-day life. Some such\nexamples are :\n(i) Reena applied for a job and got selected. She\nhas been offered a job with a starting monthly\nsalary of ` 8000, with an annual increment of\n` 500 in her salary. Her salary (in `) for the 1st,\n2nd, 3rd, . . . years will be, respectively\n8000, 8500, 9000, . . . . (ii) The lengths of the rungs of a ladder decrease\nuniformly by 2 cm from bottom to top\n(see Fig. 5.1). The bottom rung is 45 cm in\nlength. The lengths (in cm) of the 1st, 2nd,\n3rd, . . ., 8th rung from the bottom to the top\nare, respectively\nFig. 5.1\n45, 43, 41, 39, 37, 35, 33, 31\n5\n(iii) In a savings scheme, the amount becomes times of itself after every 3 years. 4\nThe maturity amount (in `) of an investment of ` 8000 after 3, 6, 9 and 12 years\nwill be, respectively :\n10000, 12500, 15625, 19531.25\nReprint 2025-26\n50 MATHEMATICS\n(iv) The number of unit squares in squares with side 1, 2, 3, . . . units (see Fig. 5.2)\nare, respectively\n12, 22, 32, . . . .

The amounts of money (in `) in the\nbox on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, . . . birthday were\n100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively. (vi) A pair of rabbits are too young to produce in their first month. In the second, and\nevery subsequent month, they produce a new pair. Each new pair of rabbits\nproduce a new pair in their second month and in every subsequent month (see\nFig. 5.3). Assuming no rabbit dies, the number of pairs of rabbits at the start of\nthe 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., 6th month, respectively are :\n1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8\nFig. 5.3\nReprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 51\nIn the examples above, we observe some patterns. In some, we find that the\nsucceeding terms are obtained by adding a fixed number, in other by multiplying\nwith a fixed number, in another we find that they are squares of consecutive\nnumbers, and so on. In this chapter, we shall discuss one of these patterns in which succeeding terms\nare obtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding terms. We shall also see how\nto find their nth terms and the sum of n consecutive terms, and use this knowledge in\nsolving some daily life problems. 5.2 Arithmetic Progressions\nConsider the following lists of numbers :\n(i) 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . (ii) 100, 70, 40, 10, . . . (iii) –3, –2, –1, 0, . . . (iv) 3, 3, 3, 3, . . . (v) –1.0, –1.5, –2.0, –2.5, . . . Each of the numbers in the list is called a term. Given a term, can you write the next term in each of the lists above? If so, how\nwill you write it? Perhaps by following a pattern or rule. Let us observe and write the\nrule.", "In (i), each term is 1 more than the term preceding it. In (ii), each term is 30 less than the term preceding it. In (iii), each term is obtained by adding 1 to the term preceding it. In (iv), all the terms in the list are 3 , i.e., each term is obtained by adding\n(or subtracting) 0 to the term preceding it. In (v), each term is obtained by adding – 0.5 to (i.e., subtracting 0.5 from) the\nterm preceding it. In all the lists above, we see that successive terms are obtained by adding a fixed\nnumber to the preceding terms. Such list of numbers is said to form an Arithmetic\nProgression ( AP ). So, an arithmetic progression is a list of numbers in which each term is\nobtained by adding a fixed number to the preceding term except the first\nterm. This fixed number is called the common difference of the AP. Remember that\nit can be positive, negative or zero. Reprint 2025-26\n52 MATHEMATICS\nLet us denote the first term of an AP by a , second term by a , . . ., nth term by\n1 2\na and the common difference by d. Then the AP becomes a , a , a , . . ., a . n 1 2 3 n\nSo, a – a = a – a = . . . = a – a = d. 2 1 3 2 n n – 1\nSome more examples of AP are:\n(a) The heights ( in cm ) of some students of a school standing in a queue in the\nmorning assembly are 147 , 148, 149, . . ., 157. (b) The minimum temperatures ( in degree celsius ) recorded for a week in the\nmonth of January in a city, arranged in ascending order are\n– 3.1, – 3.0, – 2.9, – 2.8, – 2.7, – 2.6, – 2.5\n(c) The balance money ( in ` ) after paying 5 % of the total loan of ` 1000 every\nmonth is 950, 900, 850, 800, . . ., 50. (d) The cash prizes ( in ` ) given by a school to the toppers of Classes I to XII are,\nrespectively, 200, 250, 300, 350, . . ., 750. (e) The total savings (in `) after every month for 10 months when ` 50 are saved\neach month are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500. It is left as an exercise for you to explain why each of the lists above is an AP. You can see that\na, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . represents an arithmetic progression where a is the first term and d the common\ndifference. This is called the general form of an AP. Note that in examples (a) to (e) above, there are only a finite number of terms. Such an AP is called a finite AP. Also note that each of these Arithmetic Progressions\n(APs) has a last term. The APs in examples (i) to (v) in this section, are not finite APs\nand so they are called infinite Arithmetic Progressions. Such APs do not have a\nlast term. Now, to know about an AP, what is the minimum information that you need? Is it\nenough to know the first term? Or, is it enough to know only the common difference? You will find that you will need to know both – the first term a and the common\ndifference d. For instance if the first term a is 6 and the common difference d is 3, then\nthe AP is\n6, 9,12, 15, . . . and if a is 6 and d is – 3, then the AP is\n6, 3, 0, –3, . . .", "Reprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 53\nSimilarly, when\na = – 7, d = – 2, the AP is – 7, – 9, – 11, – 13, . . . a = 1.0, d = 0.1, the AP is 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, . . . 1 1 1\na = 0, d = 1 , the AP is 0, 1 , 3, 4 , 6, . . . 2 2 2\na = 2, d = 0, the AP is 2, 2, 2, 2, . . . So, if you know what a and d are, you can list the AP. What about the other way\nround? That is, if you are given a list of numbers can you say that it is an AP and then\nfind a and d? Since a is the first term, it can easily be written. We know that in an AP,\nevery succeeding term is obtained by adding d to the preceding term. So, d found by\nsubtracting any term from its succeeding term, i.e., the term which immediately follows\nit should be same for an AP. For example, for the list of numbers :\n6, 9, 12, 15, . . . ,\nWe have a – a = 9 – 6 = 3,\n2 1\na – a = 12 – 9 = 3,\n3 2\na – a = 15 – 12 = 3\n4 3\nHere the difference of any two consecutive terms in each case is 3. So, the\ngiven list is an AP whose first term a is 6 and common difference d is 3. For the list of numbers :6, 3, 0, – 3, . . .,\na – a = 3 – 6 = – 3\n2 1\na – a = 0 – 3 = – 3\n3 2\na – a = –3 – 0 = –3\n4 3\nSimilarly this is also an AP whose first term is 6 and the common difference\nis –3. In general, for an AP a , a , . . ., a , we have\n1 2 n\nd = a – a\nk + 1 k\nwhere a and a are the ( k + 1)th and the kth terms respectively. k + 1 k\nTo obtain d in a given AP, we need not find all of a – a , a – a , a – a , . . . . 2 1 3 2 4 3\nIt is enough to find only one of them. Consider the list of numbers 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, . . . . By looking at it, you can tell that the\ndifference between any two consecutive terms is not the same. So, this is not an AP. Reprint 2025-26\n54 MATHEMATICS\nNote that to find d in the AP : 6, 3, 0, – 3, . . ., we have subtracted 6 from 3\nand not 3 from 6, i.e., we should subtract the kth term from the (k + 1) th term\neven if the (k + 1) th term is smaller. Let us make the concept more clear through some examples. 3 1 1 3\nExample 1 : For the AP : , , – , – , . . ., write the first term a and the\n2 2 2 2\ncommon difference d. 3 1 3\nSolution : Here, a = , d = – = – 1. 2 2 2\nRemember that we can find d using any two consecutive terms, once we know that\nthe numbers are in AP. Example 2 : Which of the following list of numbers form an AP? If they form an AP,\nwrite the next two terms :\n(i) 4, 10, 16, 22, . . . (ii) 1, – 1, – 3, – 5, . . . (iii) – 2, 2, – 2, 2, – 2, . . . (iv) 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, . . . Solution : (i) We have a – a = 10 – 4 = 6\n2 1\na – a = 16 – 10 = 6\n3 2\na – a = 22 – 16 = 6\n4 3\ni.e., a – a is the same every time. k + 1 k\nSo, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = 6. The next two terms are: 22 + 6 = 28 and 28 + 6 = 34. (ii) a – a = – 1 – 1 = – 2\n2 1\na – a = – 3 – ( –1 ) = – 3 + 1 = – 2\n3 2\na – a = – 5 – ( –3 ) = – 5 + 3 = – 2\n4 3\ni.e., a – a is the same every time. k + 1 k\nSo, the given list of numbers forms an AP with the common difference d = –2.", "The next two terms are:\n– 5 + (– 2 ) = – 7 and – 7 + (– 2 ) = – 9\n(iii) a – a = 2 – (– 2) = 2 + 2 = 4\n2 1\na – a = – 2 – 2 = – 4\n3 2\nAs a – a  a – a , the given list of numbers does not form an AP. 2 1 3 2\nReprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 55\n(iv) a – a = 1 – 1 = 0\n2 1\na – a = 1 – 1 = 0\n3 2\na – a = 2 – 1 = 1\n4 3\nHere, a – a = a – a  a – a . 2 1 3 2 4 3\nSo, the given list of numbers does not form an AP. EXERCISE 5.1\n1. In which of the following situations, does the list of numbers involved make an arithmetic\nprogression, and why? (i) The taxi fare after each km when the fare is ` 15 for the first km and ` 8 for each\nadditional km. 1\n(ii) The amount of air present in a cylinder when a vacuum pump removes of the\n4\nair remaining in the cylinder at a time.

She has been offered the job with a starting monthly salary of\n` 8000, with an annual increment of ` 500. What would be her monthly salary for the\nfifth year? To answer this, let us first see what her monthly salary for the second year\nwould be. It would be ` (8000 + 500) = ` 8500. In the same way, we can find the monthly\nsalary for the 3rd, 4th and 5th year by adding ` 500 to the salary of the previous year.", "So, the salary for the 3rd year = ` (8500 + 500)\n= ` (8000 + 500 + 500)\n= ` (8000 + 2 × 500)\n= ` [8000 + (3 – 1) × 500] (for the 3rd year)\n= ` 9000\nSalary for the 4th year = ` (9000 + 500)\n= ` (8000 + 500 + 500 + 500)\n= ` (8000 + 3 × 500)\n= ` [8000 + (4 – 1) × 500] (for the 4th year)\n= ` 9500\nSalary for the 5th year = ` (9500 + 500)\n= ` (8000+500+500+500 + 500)\n= ` (8000 + 4 × 500)\n= ` [8000 + (5 – 1) × 500] (for the 5th year)\n= ` 10000\nObserve that we are getting a list of numbers\n8000, 8500, 9000, 9500, 10000, . . . These numbers are in AP. (Why?)\nReprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 57\nNow, looking at the pattern formed above, can you find her monthly salary for\nthe 6th year? The 15th year? And, assuming that she will still be working in the job,\nwhat about the monthly salary for the 25th year? You would calculate this by adding\n` 500 each time to the salary of the previous year to give the answer. Can we make\nthis process shorter? Let us see. You may have already got some idea from the way\nwe have obtained the salaries above. Salary for the 15th year\n= Salary for the 14th year + ` 500\n= \n= ` [8000 + 14 × 500]\n= ` [8000 + (15 – 1) × 500] = ` 15000\ni.e., First salary + (15 – 1) × Annual increment. In the same way, her monthly salary for the 25th year would be\n` [8000 + (25 – 1) × 500] = ` 20000\n= First salary + (25 – 1) × Annual increment\nThis example would have given you some idea about how to write the 15th term,\nor the 25th term, and more generally, the nth term of the AP. Let a , a , a , . . . be an AP whose first term a is a and the common\n1 2 3 1\ndifference is d. Then,\nthe second term a = a + d = a + (2 – 1) d\n2\nthe third term a = a + d = (a + d) + d = a + 2d = a + (3 – 1) d\n3 2\nthe fourth term a = a + d = (a + 2d) + d = a + 3d = a + (4 – 1) d\n4 3\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Looking at the pattern, we can say that the nth term a = a + (n – 1) d. n\nSo, the nth term a of the AP with first term a and common difference d is\nn\ngiven by a = a + (n – 1) d. n\nReprint 2025-26\n58 MATHEMATICS\na is also called the general term of the AP. If there are m terms in the AP, then\nn\na represents the last term which is sometimes also denoted by l. m\nLet us consider some examples. Example 3 : Find the 10th term of the AP : 2, 7, 12, . . . Solution : Here, a = 2, d = 7 – 2 = 5 and n = 10. We have a = a + (n – 1) d\nn\nSo, a = 2 + (10 – 1) × 5 = 2 + 45 = 47\n10\nTherefore, the 10th term of the given AP is 47. Example 4 : Which term of the AP : 21, 18, 15, . . . is – 81? Also, is any term 0? Give\nreason for your answer. Solution :Here, a = 21, d = 18 – 21 = – 3 and a = – 81, and we have to find n. n\nAs a = a + ( n – 1) d,\nn\nwe have – 81 = 21 + (n – 1)(– 3)\n– 81 = 24 – 3n\n– 105 = – 3n\nSo, n = 35\nTherefore, the 35th term of the given AP is – 81. Next, we want to know if there is any n for which a = 0. If such an n is there, then\nn\n21 + (n – 1) (–3) = 0,\ni.e., 3(n – 1) = 21\ni.e., n = 8\nSo, the eighth term is 0.", "Example 5 : Determine the AP whose 3rd term is 5 and the 7th term is 9. Solution : We have\na = a + (3 – 1) d = a + 2d = 5 (1)\n3\nand a = a + (7 – 1) d = a + 6d = 9 (2)\n7\nSolving the pair of linear equations (1) and (2), we get\na = 3, d = 1\nHence, the required AP is 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, . . . Reprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 59\nExample 6 : Check whether 301 is a term of the list of numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, . . . Solution : We have :\na – a = 11 – 5 = 6, a – a = 17 – 11 = 6, a – a = 23 – 17 = 6\n2 1 3 2 4 3\nAs a – a is the same for k = 1, 2, 3, etc., the given list of numbers is an AP. k + 1 k\nNow, a = 5 and d = 6. Let 301 be a term, say, the nth term of this AP. We know that\na = a + (n – 1) d\nn\nSo, 301 = 5 + (n – 1) × 6\ni.e., 301 = 6n – 1\n302 151\nSo, n = \n6 3\nBut n should be a positive integer (Why?). So, 301 is not a term of the given list of\nnumbers. Example 7 : How many two-digit numbers are divisible by 3? Solution : The list of two-digit numbers divisible by 3 is :\n12, 15, 18, . . . , 99\nIs this an AP? Yes it is. Here, a = 12, d = 3, a = 99. n\nAs a = a + (n – 1) d,\nn\nwe have 99 = 12 + (n – 1) × 3\ni.e., 87 = (n – 1) × 3\n87\ni.e., n – 1 = = 29\n3\ni.e., n = 29 + 1 = 30\nSo, there are 30 two-digit numbers divisible by 3. Example 8 : Find the 11th term from the last term (towards the first term) of the\nAP : 10, 7, 4, . . ., – 62. Solution : Here, a = 10, d = 7 – 10 = – 3, l = – 62,\nwhere l = a + (n – 1) d\nReprint 2025-26\n60 MATHEMATICS\nTo find the 11th term from the last term, we will find the total number of terms in\nthe AP. So, – 62 = 10 + (n – 1)(–3)\ni.e., – 72 = (n – 1)(–3)\ni.e., n – 1 = 24\nor n = 25\nSo, there are 25 terms in the given AP. The 11th term from the last term will be the 15th term. (Note that it will not be\nthe 14th term. Why?)\nSo, a = 10 + (15 – 1)(–3) = 10 – 42 = – 32\n15\ni.e., the 11th term from the last term is – 32. Alternative Solution :\nIf we write the given AP in the reverse order, then a = – 62 and d = 3 (Why?)\nSo, the question now becomes finding the 11th term with these a and d. So, a = – 62 + (11 – 1) × 3 = – 62 + 30 = – 32\n11\nSo, the 11th term, which is now the required term, is – 32. Example 9 : A sum of ` 1000 is invested at 8% simple interest per year. Calculate the\ninterest at the end of each year. Do these interests form an AP? If so, find the interest\nat the end of 30 years making use of this fact. Solution : We know that the formula to calculate simple interest is given by\nP×R×T\nSimple Interest =\n100\n1000×8×1\nSo, the interest at the end of the 1st year = ` = ` 80\n100\n1000×8×2\nThe interest at the end of the 2nd year = ` = ` 160\n100\n1000×8×3\nThe interest at the end of the 3rd year = ` = ` 240\n100\nSimilarly, we can obtain the interest at the end of the 4th year, 5th year, and so on. So, the interest (in `) at the end of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . years, respectively are\n80, 160, 240, . . .", "Reprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 61\nIt is an AP as the difference between the consecutive terms in the list is 80, i.e.,\nd = 80. Also, a = 80. So, to find the interest at the end of 30 years, we shall find a . 30\nNow, a = a + (30 – 1) d = 80 + 29 × 80 = 2400\n30\nSo, the interest at the end of 30 years will be ` 2400.

How much\nmoney will be collected in the money\nbox by the time her daughter is 21\nyears old? Here, the amount of money (in `) put in the money box on her first, second, third,\nfourth . . . birthday were respectively 100, 150, 200, 250, . . . till her 21st birthday. To\nfind the total amount in the money box on her 21st birthday, we will have to write each\nof the 21 numbers in the list above and then add them up. Don’t you think it would be\na tedious and time consuming process? Can we make the process shorter? This would\nbe possible if we can find a method for getting this sum. Let us see. We consider the problem given to Gauss (about whom you read in\nChapter 1), to solve when he was just 10 years old. He was asked to find the sum of\nthe positive integers from 1 to 100. He immediately replied that the sum is 5050. Can\nyou guess how did he do? He wrote :\nS = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 99 + 100\nAnd then, reversed the numbers to write\nS = 100 + 99 + . . . + 3 + 2 + 1\nAdding these two, he got\n2S = (100 + 1) + (99 + 2) + . . . + (3 + 98) + (2 + 99) + (1 + 100)\n= 101 + 101 + . . . + 101 + 101 (100 times)\n100101\nSo, S = 5050, i.e., the sum = 5050. 2\nReprint 2025-26\n64 MATHEMATICS\nWe will now use the same technique to find the sum of the first n terms of an AP :\na, a + d, a + 2d, . . . The nth term of this AP is a + (n – 1) d. Let S denote the sum of the first n terms\nof the AP. We have\nS = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + . . . + [a + (n – 1) d] (1)\nRewriting the terms in reverse order, we have\nS = [a + (n – 1) d] + [a + (n – 2) d] + . . . + (a + d) + a (2)\nOn adding (1) and (2), term-wise. we get\n[2a (n 1)d][2a  (n 1)d]...[2a  (n 1)d][2a (n 1)d]\n\n2S =\nn times\nor, 2S = n [2a + (n – 1) d] (Since, there are n terms)\nn\nor, S = [2a + (n – 1) d]\n2\nSo, the sum of the first n terms of an AP is given by\nn\nS = [2a + (n – 1) d]\n2\nn\nWe can also write this as S = [a + a + (n – 1) d]\n2\nn\ni.e., S = (a + a ) (3)\n2 n\nNow, if there are only n terms in an AP, then a = l, the last term. n\nFrom (3), we see that\nn\nS = (a + l) (4)\n2\nThis form of the result is useful when the first and the last terms of an AP are\ngiven and the common difference is not given. Now we return to the question that was posed to us in the beginning. The amount\nof money (in Rs) in the money box of Shakila’s daughter on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th birthday,\n. .", "., were 100, 150, 200, 250, . . ., respectively. This is an AP. We have to find the total money collected on her 21st birthday, i.e.,\nthe sum of the first 21 terms of this AP. Reprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 65\nHere, a = 100, d = 50 and n = 21. Using the formula :\nn\nS = 2a(n1)d,\n2\n21 21\nwe have S = 2100(211)50 = 2001000\n2 2\n21\n= 1200 = 12600\n2\nSo, the amount of money collected on her 21st birthday is ` 12600. Hasn’t the use of the formula made it much easier to solve the problem? We also use S in place of S to denote the sum of first n terms of the AP. We\nn\nwrite S to denote the sum of the first 20 terms of an AP. The formula for the sum of\n20\nthe first n terms involves four quantities S, a, d and n. If we know any three of them,\nwe can find the fourth. Remark : The nth term of an AP is the difference of the sum to first n terms and the\nsum to first (n – 1) terms of it, i.e., a = S – S . n n n – 1\nLet us consider some examples. Example 11 : Find the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP : 8, 3, –2, . . . Solution : Here, a = 8, d = 3 – 8 = –5, n = 22. We know that\nn\nS = 2a(n1)d\n2\n22\nTherefore, S = 1621(5) = 11(16 – 105) = 11(–89) = – 979\n2\nSo, the sum of the first 22 terms of the AP is – 979. Example 12 : If the sum of the first 14 terms of an AP is 1050 and its first term is 10,\nfind the 20th term. Solution : Here, S = 1050, n = 14, a = 10. 14\nn\nAs S = 2a(n1)d,\nn 2\n14\nso, 1050 = 2013d= 140 + 91d\n2\nReprint 2025-26\n66 MATHEMATICS\ni.e., 910 = 91d\nor, d = 10\nTherefore, a = 10 + (20 – 1) × 10 = 200, i.e. 20th term is 200. 20\nExample 13 : How many terms of the AP : 24, 21, 18, . . . must be taken so that their\nsum is 78? Solution : Here, a = 24, d = 21 – 24 = –3, S = 78. We need to find n. n\nn\nWe know that S = 2a(n1)d\nn 2\nn n\nSo, 78 = 48(n1)(3) = 513n\n2 2\nor 3n2 – 51n + 156 = 0\nor n2 – 17n + 52 = 0\nor (n – 4)(n – 13) = 0\nor n = 4 or 13\nBoth values of n are admissible. So, the number of terms is either 4 or 13. Remarks:\n1. In this case, the sum of the first 4 terms = the sum of the first 13 terms = 78. 2. Two answers are possible because the sum of the terms from 5th to 13th will be\nzero. This is because a is positive and d is negative, so that some terms will be\npositive and some others negative, and will cancel out each other. Example 14 : Find the sum of :\n(i) the first 1000 positive integers (ii) the first n positive integers\nSolution :\n(i) Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + 1000\nn\nUsing the formula S = (al) for the sum of the first n terms of an AP, we\nn 2\nhave\n1000\nS = (11000) = 500 × 1001 = 500500\n1000 2\nSo, the sum of the first 1000 positive integers is 500500. (ii) Let S = 1 + 2 + 3 + . . . + n\nn\nHere a = 1 and the last term l is n.", "Reprint 2025-26\nARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 67\nn(1n) n(n1)\nTherefore, S = or S =\nn 2 n 2\nSo, the sum of first n positive integers is given by\nn(n +1)\nS =\nn 2\nExample 15 : Find the sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers whose nth term is\ngiven by\na = 3 + 2n\nn\nSolution :\nAs a = 3 + 2n,\nn\nso, a = 3 + 2 = 5\n1\na = 3 + 2 × 2 = 7\n2\na = 3 + 2 × 3 = 9\n3\n\nList of numbers becomes 5, 7, 9, 11, . . . Here, 7 – 5 = 9 – 7 = 11 – 9 = 2 and so on. So, it forms an AP with common difference d = 2. To find S , we have n = 24, a = 5, d = 2. 24\n24\nTherefore, S = 25(241)2 = 121046 = 672\n24 2\nSo, sum of first 24 terms of the list of numbers is 672. Example 16 : A manufacturer of TV sets produced 600 sets in the third year and 700\nsets in the seventh year. Assuming that the production increases uniformly by a fixed\nnumber every year, find :\n(i) the production in the 1st year (ii) the production in the 10th year\n(iii) the total production in first 7 years\nSolution : (i) Since the production increases uniformly by a fixed number every year,\nthe number of TV sets manufactured in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . ., years will form an AP. Let us denote the number of TV sets manufactured in the nth year by a . n\nThen, a = 600 and a = 700\n3 7\nReprint 2025-26\n68 MATHEMATICS\nor, a + 2d = 600\nand a + 6d = 700\nSolving these equations, we get d = 25 and a = 550. Therefore, production of TV sets in the first year is 550. (ii) Now a = a + 9d = 550 + 9 × 25 = 775\n10\nSo, production of TV sets in the 10th year is 775. 7\n(iii) Also, S = 2550(71)25\n7 2\n7\n= 1100150 = 4375\n2\nThus, the total production of TV sets in first 7 years is 4375.
