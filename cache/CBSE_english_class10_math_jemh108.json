["INTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 113\nI\nNTRODUCTION TO 8\nT\nRIGONOMETRY\nThere is perhaps nothing which so occupies the\nmiddle position of mathematics as trigonometry. – J.F. Herbart (1890)\n8.1 Introduction\nYou have already studied about triangles, and in particular, right triangles, in your\nearlier classes. Let us take some examples from our surroundings where right triangles\ncan be imagined to be formed. For instance :\n1. Suppose the students of a school are\nvisiting Qutub Minar. Now, if a student\nis looking at the top of the Minar, a right\ntriangle can be imagined to be made,\nas shown in Fig 8.1. Can the student\nfind out the height of the Minar, without\nactually measuring it? 2. Suppose a girl is sitting on the balcony\nof her house located on the bank of a Fig. 8.1\nriver. She is looking down at a flower\npot placed on a stair of a temple situated\nnearby on the other bank of the river. A right triangle is imagined to be made\nin this situation as shown in Fig.8.2. If\nyou know the height at which the\nperson is sitting, can you find the width\nof the river? Fig. 8.2\nReprint 2025-26\n114 MATHEMATICS\n3. Suppose a hot air balloon is flying in\nthe air. A girl happens to spot the\nballoon in the sky and runs to her\nmother to tell her about it. Her mother\nrushes out of the house to look at the\nballoon.Now when the girl had spotted\nthe balloon intially it was at point A. When both the mother and daughter\ncame out to see it, it had already\ntravelled to another point B. Can you\nFig. 8.3\nfind the altitude of B from the ground? In all the situations given above, the distances or heights can be found by using\nsome mathematical techniques, which come under a branch of mathematics called\n‘trigonometry’. The word ‘trigonometry’ is derived from the Greek words ‘tri’\n(meaning three), ‘gon’ (meaning sides) and ‘metron’ (meaning measure). In fact,\ntrigonometry is the study of relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. The earliest known work on trigonometry was recorded in Egypt and Babylon. Early\nastronomers used it to find out the distances of the stars and planets from the Earth. Even today, most of the technologically advanced methods used in Engineering and\nPhysical Sciences are based on trigonometrical concepts. In this chapter, we will study some ratios of the sides of a right triangle with\nrespect to its acute angles, called trigonometric ratios of the angle. We will restrict\nour discussion to acute angles only. However, these ratios can be extended to other\nangles also. We will also define the trigonometric ratios for angles of measure 0° and\n90°. We will calculate trigonometric ratios for some specific angles and establish\nsome identities involving these ratios, called trigonometric identities. 8.2 Trigonometric Ratios\nIn Section 8.1, you have seen some right triangles\nimagined to be formed in different situations. Let us take a right triangle ABC as shown\nin Fig. 8.4. Here,  CAB (or, in brief, angle A) is an\nacute angle.", "Note the position of the side BC\nwith respect to angle A. It faces  A. We call it\nthe side opposite to angle A. AC is the\nhypotenuse of the right triangle and the side AB\nis a part of  A. So, we call it the side\nFig. 8.4\nadjacent to angle A. Reprint 2025-26\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 115\nNote that the position of sides change\nwhen you consider angle C in place of A\n(see Fig. 8.5). You have studied the concept of ‘ratio’ in\nyour earlier classes. We now define certain ratios\ninvolving the sides of a right triangle, and call\nthem trigonometric ratios. The trigonometric ratios of the angle A\nin right triangle ABC (see Fig. 8.4) are defined\nas follows :\nFig. 8.5\nside opposite to angle A BC\nsine of  A = \nhypotenuse AC\nside adjacent to angle A AB\ncosine of  A = \nhypotenuse AC\nsideopposite to angle A BC\ntangent of  A = \nside adjacent to angle A AB\n1 hypotenuse AC\ncosecant of  A =  \nsine of A side opposite to angle A BC\n1 hypotenuse AC\nsecant of  A =  \ncosine of  A side adjacent to angle A AB\n1 side adjacent to angle A AB\ncotangent of  A =  \ntangent of A side opposite to angle A BC\nThe ratios defined above are abbreviated as sin A, cos A, tan A, cosec A, sec A\nand cot A respectively. Note that the ratios cosec A, sec A and cot A are respectively,\nthe reciprocals of the ratios sin A, cos A and tan A. BC\nBC AC sin A cosA . Also, observe that tan A =   and cot A =\nAB AB cos A sinA\nAC\nSo, the trigonometric ratios of an acute angle in a right triangle express the\nrelationship between the angle and the length of its sides. Why don’t you try to define the trigonometric ratios for angle C in the right\ntriangle? (See Fig. 8.5)\nReprint 2025-26\n116 MATHEMATICS\nThe first use of the idea of ‘sine’ in the way we use\nit today was in the work Aryabhatiyam by Aryabhata,\nin A.D. 500. Aryabhata used the word ardha-jya\nfor the half-chord, which was shortened to jya or\njiva in due course. When the Aryabhatiyam was\ntranslated into Arabic, the word jiva was retained as\nit is. The word jiva was translated into sinus, which\nmeans curve, when the Arabic version was translated\ninto Latin. Soon the word sinus, also used as sine,\nbecame common in mathematical texts throughout\nEurope. An English Professor of astronomy Edmund\nAryabhata\nGunter (1581–1626), first used the abbreviated\nC.E. 476 – 550\nnotation ‘sin’. The origin of the terms ‘cosine’ and ‘tangent’ was much later. The cosine function\narose from the need to compute the sine of the complementary angle. Aryabhatta\ncalled it kotijya. The name cosinus originated with Edmund Gunter. In 1674, the\nEnglish Mathematician Sir Jonas Moore first used the abbreviated notation ‘cos’. Remark : Note that the symbol sin A is used as an\nabbreviation for ‘the sine of the angle A’. sin A is not\nthe product of ‘sin’ and A. ‘sin’ separated from A\nhas no meaning. Similarly, cos A is not the product of\n‘cos’ and A. Similar interpretations follow for other\ntrigonometric ratios also.", "Now, if we take a point P on the hypotenuse\nAC or a point Q on AC extended, of the right triangle\nABC and draw PM perpendicular to AB and QN\nperpendicular to AB extended (see Fig. 8.6), how\nwill the trigonometric ratios of  A in  PAM differ\nfrom those of  A in  CAB or from those of  A in Fig. 8.6\n QAN? To answer this, first look at these triangles. Is  PAM similar to  CAB? From\nChapter 6, recall the AA similarity criterion. Using the criterion, you will see that the\ntriangles PAM and CAB are similar. Therefore, by the property of similar triangles,\nthe corresponding sides of the triangles are proportional. AM AP MP\nSo, we have =  \nAB AC BC\nReprint 2025-26\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 117\nMP BC\nFrom this, we find = sin A. AP AC\nAM AB MP BC\nSimilarly,  = cos A,   tan A and so on. AP AC AM AB\nThis shows that the trigonometric ratios of angle A in  PAM not differ from\nthose of angle A in  CAB. In the same way, you should check that the value of sin A (and also of other\ntrigonometric ratios) remains the same in  QAN also. From our observations, it is now clear that the values of the trigonometric\nratios of an angle do not vary with the lengths of the sides of the triangle, if\nthe angle remains the same. Note : For the sake of convenience, we may write sin2A, cos2A, etc., in place of\n(sin A)2, (cos A)2, etc., respectively. But cosec A = (sin A)–1  sin–1 A (it is called sine\ninverse A). sin–1 A has a different meaning, which will be discussed in higher classes. Similar conventions hold for the other trigonometric ratios as well. Sometimes, the\nGreek letter  (theta) is also used to denote an angle. We have defined six trigonometric ratios of an acute angle. If we know any one\nof the ratios, can we obtain the other ratios? Let us see. 1\nIf in a right triangle ABC, sin A = ,\n3\nBC 1\nthen this means that  , i.e., the\nAC 3\nlengths of the sides BC and AC of the triangle\nABC are in the ratio 1 : 3 (see Fig. 8.7). So if\nBC is equal to k, then AC will be 3k, where\nFig. 8.7\nk is any positive number. To determine other\ntrigonometric ratios for the angle A, we need to find the length of the third side\nAB. Do you remember the Pythagoras theorem? Let us use it to determine the\nrequired length AB. AB2 = AC2 – BC2 = (3k)2 – (k)2 = 8k2 = (2 2 k)2\nTherefore, AB =  2 2k\nSo, we get AB = 2 2k (Why is AB not –2 2k?)\nAB 2 2k 2 2\nNow, cos A =  \nAC 3k 3\nSimilarly, you can obtain the other trigonometric ratios of the angle A. Reprint 2025-26\n118 MATHEMATICS\nRemark : Since the hypotenuse is the longest side in a right triangle, the value of\nsin A or cos A is always less than 1 (or, in particular, equal to 1). Let us consider some examples. 4\nExample 1 : Given tan A = , find the other\n3\ntrigonometric ratios of the angle A. Solution : Let us first draw a right  ABC\n(see Fig 8.8). BC 4\nNow, we know that tan A =  . AB 3\nTherefore, if BC = 4k, then AB = 3k, where k is a\npositive number. Fig.", "8.8\nNow, by using the Pythagoras Theorem, we have\nAC2 = AB2 + BC2 = (4k)2 + (3k)2 = 25k2\nSo, AC = 5k\nNow, we can write all the trigonometric ratios using their definitions. BC 4k 4\nsin A =  \nAC 5k 5\nAB 3k 3\ncos A =  \nAC 5k 5\n1 3 1 5 1 5\nTherefore, cot A =  ,cosec A =  and sec A =  \ntanA 4 sin A 4 cos A 3\nExample 2 : If  B and  Q are\nacute angles such that sin B = sin Q,\nthen prove that  B =  Q. Solution : Let us consider two right\ntriangles ABC and PQR where\nsin B = sin Q (see Fig. 8.9).

So, BC = AB (Why?)\nNow, Suppose BC = AB = a.

Consider an equilateral triangle ABC. Since\neach angle in an equilateral triangle is 60°, therefore,\n A =  B =  C = 60°. Draw the perpendicular AD from A to the side BC\n(see Fig. 8.15). Fig. 8.15\nNow  ABD   ACD (Why?)\nTherefore, BD = DC\nand  BAD =  CAD (CPCT)\nNow observe that:\n ABD is a right triangle, right-angled at D with  BAD = 30° and  ABD = 60°\n(see Fig. 8.15). Reprint 2025-26\nINTRODUCTION TO TRIGONOMETRY 123\nAs you know, for finding the trigonometric ratios, we need to know the lengths of the\nsides of the triangle. So, let us suppose that AB = 2a. 1\nThen, BD = BC= a\n2\nand AD2 = AB2 – BD2 = (2a)2 – (a)2 = 3a2,\nTherefore, AD = a 3\nNow, we have :\nBD a 1 AD a 3 3\nsin 30° =   , cos 30° =  \nAB 2a 2 AB 2a 2\nBD a 1\ntan 30° =   .

As  A gets smaller and\nsmaller, the length of the side BC decreases.The point C gets\ncloser to point B, and finally when  A becomes very close\nFig. 8.16\nto 0°, AC becomes almost the same as AB (see Fig. 8.17). Fig.", "8.17\nReprint 2025-26\n124 MATHEMATICS\nWhen  A is very close to 0°, BC gets very close to 0 and so the value of\nBC\nsin A = is very close to 0. Also, when  A is very close to 0°, AC is nearly the\nAC\nAB\nsame as AB and so the value of cos A = is very close to 1. AC\nThis helps us to see how we can define the values of sin A and cos A when\nA = 0°. We define : sin 0° = 0 and cos 0° = 1. Using these, we have :\nsin 0° 1\n,\ntan 0° = = 0, cot 0° = which is not defined.(Why?)\ncos0° tan 0°\n1 1\nsec 0° = = 1 and cosec 0° = , which is again not defined.(Why?)\ncos 0 sin 0\nNow, let us see what happens to the trigonometric ratios of  A, when it is made\nlarger and larger in  ABC till it becomes 90°. As  A gets larger and larger,  C gets\nsmaller and smaller. Therefore, as in the case above, the length of the side AB goes on\ndecreasing. The point A gets closer to point B. Finally when  A is very close to 90°,\n C becomes very close to 0° and the side AC almost coincides with side BC\n(see Fig. 8.18). Fig. 8.18\nWhen  C is very close to 0°,  A is very close to 90°, side AC is nearly the\nsame as side BC, and so sin A is very close to 1. Also when  A is very close to 90°,\n C is very close to 0°, and the side AB is nearly zero, so cos A is very close to 0. So, we define : sin 90° = 1 and cos 90° = 0. Now, why don’t you find the other trigonometric ratios of 90°? We shall now give the values of all the trigonometric ratios of 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°\nand 90° in Table 8.1, for ready reference.

Determine the lengths of the sides BC and AC. Solution : To find the length of the side BC, we will\nchoose the trigonometric ratio involving BC and the\ngiven side AB.
