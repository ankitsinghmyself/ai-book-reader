["SOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 133\nS A\nOME PPLICATIONS OF 9\nT\nRIGONOMETRY\n9.1 Heights and Distances\nIn the previous chapter, you have studied about trigonometric ratios. In this chapter,\nyou will be studying about some ways in which trigonometry is used in the life around\nyou. Let us consider Fig. 8.1 of prvious chapter, which is redrawn below in Fig. 9.1. Fig. 9.1\nIn this figure, the line AC drawn from the eye of the student to the top of the\nminar is called the line of sight. The student is looking at the top of the minar. The\nangle BAC, so formed by the line of sight with the horizontal, is called the angle of\nelevation of the top of the minar from the eye of the student. Thus, the line of sight is the line drawn from the eye of an observer to the point\nin the object viewed by the observer. The angle of elevation of the point viewed is\nReprint 2025-26\n134 MATHEMATICS\nthe angle formed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point being viewed is\nabove the horizontal level, i.e., the case when we raise our head to look at the object\n(see Fig. 9.2). Fig. 9.2\nNow, consider the situation given in Fig. 8.2. The girl sitting on the balcony is\nlooking down at a flower pot placed on a stair of the temple. In this case, the line of\nsight is below the horizontal level. The angle so formed by the line of sight with the\nhorizontal is called the angle of depression. Thus, the angle of depression of a point on the object being viewed is the angle\nformed by the line of sight with the horizontal when the point is below the horizontal\nlevel, i.e., the case when we lower our head to look at the point being viewed\n(see Fig. 9.3). Fig. 9.3\nNow, you may identify the lines of sight, and the angles so formed in Fig. 8.3. Are they angles of elevation or angles of depression? Let us refer to Fig. 9.1 again. If you want to find the height CD of the minar\nwithout actually measuring it, what information do you need? You would need to know\nthe following:\n(i) the distance DE at which the student is standing from the foot of the minar\nReprint 2025-26\nSOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 135\n(ii) the angle of elevation,  BAC, of the top of the minar\n(iii) the height AE of the student. Assuming that the above three conditions are known, how can we determine the\nheight of the minar? In the figure, CD = CB + BD. Here, BD = AE, which is the height of the student. To find BC, we will use trigonometric ratios of  BAC or  A. In  ABC, the side BC is the opposite side in relation to the known  A. Now,\nwhich of the trigonometric ratios can we use? Which one of them has the two values\nthat we have and the one we need to determine? Our search narrows down to using\neither tan A or cot A, as these ratios involve AB and BC. BC AB\n,\nTherefore, tan A = or cot A = which on solving would give us BC. AB BC\nBy adding AE to BC, you will get the height of the minar. Now let us explain the process, we have just discussed, by solving some problems.", "Example 1 : A tower stands vertically on the ground. From a point on the ground,\nwhich is 15 m away from the foot of the tower, the angle of elevation of the top of the\ntower is found to be 60°. Find the height of the tower. Solution : First let us draw a simple diagram to\nrepresent the problem (see Fig. 9.4). Here AB\nrepresents the tower, CB is the distance of the point\nfrom the tower and  ACB is the angle of elevation. We need to determine the height of the tower, i.e.,\nAB. Also, ACB is a triangle, right-angled at B. To solve the problem, we choose the trigonometric\nratio tan 60° (or cot 60°), as the ratio involves AB\nand BC. AB\nNow, tan 60° =\nBC\nAB\ni.e., 3 =\n15\nFig. 9.4\ni.e., AB = 15 3\nHence, the height of the tower is 15 3 m.

She needs\nto reach a point 1.3m below the top of the pole\nto undertake the repair work (see Fig. 9.5). What\nshould be the length of the ladder that she should\nuse which, when inclined at an angle of 60° to\nthe horizontal, would enable her to reach the\nrequired position? Also, how far from the foot\nof the pole should she place the foot of the\nladder? (You may take 3 = 1.73)\nSolution : In Fig. 9.5, the electrician is required to\nreach the point B on the pole AD. So, BD = AD – AB = (5 – 1.3)m = 3.7 m. Fig. 9.5\nHere, BC represents the ladder. We need to find\nits length, i.e., the hypotenuse of the right triangle BDC. Now, can you think which trigonometic ratio should we consider? It should be sin 60°. BD 3.7 3\nSo, = sin 60° or =\nBC BC 2\n3.72\nTherefore, BC = = 4.28 m (approx.)\n3\ni.e., the length of the ladder should be 4.28 m. DC 1\nNow, = cot 60° =\nBD 3\n3.7\ni.e., DC = = 2.14 m (approx.)\n3\nTherefore, she should place the foot of the ladder at a distance of 2.14 m from\nthe pole. Reprint 2025-26\nSOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 137\nExample 3 : An observer 1.5 m tall is 28.5 m away\nfrom a chimney. The angle of elevation of the top\nof the chimney from her eyes is 45°. What is the\nheight of the chimney? Solution : Here, AB is the chimney, CD the\nobserver and  ADE the angle of elevation (see\nFig. 9.6). In this case, ADE is a triangle, right-angled\nat E and we are required to find the height of the\nchimney. We have AB = AE + BE = AE + 1.5\nFig. 9.6\nand DE = CB = 28.5 m\nTo determine AE, we choose a trigonometric ratio, which involves both AE and\nDE. Let us choose the tangent of the angle of elevation. AE\nNow, tan 45° =\nDE\nAE\ni.e., 1 =\n28.5\nTherefore, AE = 28.5\nSo the height of the chimney (AB) = (28.5 + 1.5) m = 30 m. Example 4 : From a point P on the ground the angle of elevation of the top of a 10 m\ntall building is 30°. A flag is hoisted at the top of the building and the angle of elevation\nof the top of the flagstaff from P is 45°. Find the length of the flagstaff and the\ndistance of the building from the point P. (You may take 3 = 1.732)\nSolution : In Fig.", "9.7, AB denotes the height of the building, BD the flagstaff and P\nthe given point. Note that there are two right triangles PAB and PAD. We are required\nto find the length of the flagstaff, i.e., DB and the distance of the building from the\npoint P, i.e., PA. Reprint 2025-26\n138 MATHEMATICS\nSince, we know the height of the building AB, we\nwill first consider the right  PAB. AB\nWe have tan 30° =\nAP\n1 10\ni.e., =\n3 AP\nTherefore, AP = 10 3 Fig. 9.7\ni.e., the distance of the building from P is 10 3 m = 17.32 m. Next, let us suppose DB = x m. Then AD = (10 + x) m. AD 10  x\nNow, in right  PAD, tan 45° = \nAP 10 3\n10  x\nTherefore, 1 =\n10 3\n \ni.e., x = 10 3 1 = 7.32\nSo, the length of the flagstaff is 7.32 m. Example 5 : The shadow of a tower standing\non a level ground is found to be 40 m longer\nwhen the Sun’s altitude is 30° than when it is\n60°. Find the height of the tower. Solution : In Fig. 9.8, AB is the tower and\nBC is the length of the shadow when the\nSun’s altitude is 60°, i.e., the angle of\nelevation of the top of the tower from the tip\nFig. 9.8\nof the shadow is 60° and DB is the length of\nthe shadow, when the angle of elevation\nis 30°. Now, let AB be h m and BC be x m. According to the question, DB is 40 m longer\nthan BC. Reprint 2025-26\nSOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 139\nSo, DB = (40 + x) m\nNow, we have two right triangles ABC and ABD. AB\nIn  ABC, tan 60° =\nBC\nh\nor, 3 = (1)\nx\nAB\nIn  ABD, tan 30° =\nBD\n1 h\ni.e., = (2)\n3 x 40\nFrom (1), we have h = x 3\n \nPutting this value in (2), we get x 3 3 = x + 40, i.e., 3x = x + 40\ni.e., x = 20\nSo, h = 20 3 [From (1)]\nTherefore, the height of the tower is 20 3m. Example 6 : The angles of depression of the top and the bottom of an 8 m tall building\nfrom the top of a multi-storeyed building are 30°\nand 45°, respectively. Find the height of the multi-\nstoreyed building and the distance between the\ntwo buildings. Solution : In Fig. 9.9, PC denotes the multi-\nstoryed building and AB denotes the 8 m tall\nbuilding. We are interested to determine the height\nof the multi-storeyed building, i.e., PC and the\ndistance between the two buildings, i.e., AC. Look at the figure carefully. Observe that PB is\na transversal to the parallel lines PQ and BD. Therefore, QPB and PBD are alternate\nangles, and so are equal. Fig. 9.9\nSo PBD = 30°. Similarly,  PAC = 45°. In right  PBD, we have\nReprint 2025-26\n140 MATHEMATICS\nPD 1\n= tan 30° = or BD = PD 3\nBD 3\nIn right  PAC, we have\nPC\n= tan 45° = 1\nAC\ni.e., PC = AC\nAlso, PC = PD + DC, therefore, PD + DC = AC. Since, AC = BD and DC = AB = 8 m, we get PD + 8 = BD = PD 3 (Why?)\n \n8 3 1\n8\n \nThis gives PD =   4 3  1 m. 3 1  3  1  3 1 \nSo, the height of the multi-storeyed building is  4  3  1   8  m = 4  3 + 3  m\nand the distance between the two buildings is also 4  3  3  m. Example 7 : From a point on a bridge across a river, the angles of depression of\nthe banks on opposite sides of the river are 30° and 45°, respectively.", "If the bridge\nis at a height of 3 m from the banks, find the width of the river. Solution : In Fig 9.10, A and B\nrepresent points on the bank on\nopposite sides of the river, so that\nAB is the width of the river. P is a\npoint on the bridge at a height of 3\nm, i.e., DP = 3 m. We are\ninterested to determine the width Fig. 9.10\nof the river, which is the length of\nthe side AB of the D APB. Now, AB = AD + DB\nIn right  APD,  A = 30°. PD\nSo, tan 30° =\nAD\nReprint 2025-26\nSOME APPLICATIONS OF TRIGONOMETRY 141\n1 3\ni.e., = or AD = 3 3 m\n3 AD\nAlso, in right  PBD,  B = 45°. So, BD = PD = 3 m. Now, AB = BD + AD = 3 + 3 3 = 3 (1 + 3) m.  \nTherefore, the width of the river is 3 3 1 m. EXERCISE 9.1\n1.
