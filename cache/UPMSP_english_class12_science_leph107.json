["Chapter Seven\nALTERNATING\nCURRENT\n7.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nWe have so far considered direct current (dc) sources and circuits with dc\nsources. These currents do not change direction with time. But voltages\nand currents that vary with time are very common. The electric mains\nsupply in our homes and offices is a voltage that varies like a sine function\nwith time. Such a voltage is called alternating voltage (ac voltage) and\nthe current driven by it in a circuit is called the alternating current (ac\ncurrent)*. Today, most of the electrical devices we use require ac voltage. This is mainly because most of the electrical energy sold by power\ncompanies is transmitted and distributed as alternating current. The main\nreason for preferring use of ac voltage over dc voltage is that ac voltages\ncan be easily and efficiently converted from one voltage to the other by\nmeans of transformers. Further, electrical energy can also be transmitted\neconomically over long distances. AC circuits exhibit characteristics which\nare exploited in many devices of daily use. For example, whenever we\ntune our radio to a favourite station, we are taking advantage of a special\nproperty of ac circuits – one of many that you will study in this chapter. * The phrases ac voltage and ac current are contradictory and redundant,\nrespectively, since they mean, literally, alternating current voltage and alternating\ncurrent current. Still, the abbreviation ac to designate an electrical quantity\ndisplaying simple harmonic time dependance has become so universally accepted\nthat we follow others in its use. Further, voltage – another phrase commonly\nused means potential difference between two points.

But this is not so in the case of an inductor,\na capacitor or a combination of these circuit elements. In order to show\nphase relationship between voltage and current\nin an ac circuit, we use the notion of phasors. The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the\nuse of a phasor diagram. A phasor* is a vector\nwhich rotates about the origin with angular\nspeed w, as shown in Fig. 7.4. The vertical\ncomponents of phasors V and I represent the\nsinusoidally varying quantities v and i. The\nmagnitudes of phasors V and I represent the\namplitudes or the peak values v and i of these\nm m\noscillating quantities. Figure 7.4(a) shows the FIGURE 7.4 (a) A phasor diagram for the\nvoltage and current phasors and their circuit in Fig 7.1.

From Fig. 7.4(a) we see that phasors V and I for the case of a resistor are\nin the same direction. This is so for all times. This means that the phase\nangle between the voltage and the current is zero. 7.4 AC V A I\nOLTAGE PPLIED TO AN NDUCTOR\nFigure 7.5 shows an ac source connected to an inductor.

Since the source has an emf which oscillates symmetrically\nabout zero, the current it sustains also oscillates symmetrically about\nzero, so that no constant or time-independent component of the current\nexists. Therefore, the integration constant is zero.

Example 7.3 A lamp is connected in series with a capacitor. Predict\nyour observations for dc and ac connections. What happens in each\ncase if the capacitance of the capacitor is reduced? Solution When a dc source is connected to a capacitor, the capacitor\ngets charged and after charging no current flows in the circuit and\nthe lamp will not glow. There will be no change even if C is reduced. With ac source, the capacitor offers capacitative reactance (1/ωC)\nand the current flows in the circuit. Consequently, the lamp will shine.

The glow of the light bulb (a) increases; (b)\ndecreases; (c) is unchanged, as the iron rod is inserted. Give your\nanswer with reasons. Solution As the iron rod is inserted, the magnetic field inside the coil\nmagnetizes the iron increasing the magnetic field inside it. Hence,\nthe inductance of the coil increases.

The phenomenon of resonance is common among systems\nthat have a tendency to oscillate at a particular frequency. This frequency\nis called the system’s natural frequency. If such a system is driven by an\nenergy source at a frequency that is near the natural frequency, the\namplitude of oscillation is found to be large.

Since i =\nm\nv / R at resonance, the current amplitude for\nm\ncase (i) is twice to that for case (ii). Resonant circuits have a variety of applications, for example, in the\ntuning mechanism of a radio or a TV set. The antenna of a radio accepts\nsignals from many broadcasting stations. The signals picked up in the\nantenna acts as a source in the tuning circuit of the radio, so the circuit\ncan be driven at many frequencies. But to hear one particular radio\nstation, we tune the radio. In tuning, we vary the capacitance of a\ncapacitor in the tuning circuit such that the resonant frequency of the\ncircuit becomes nearly equal to the frequency of the radio signal received. When this happens, the amplitude of the current with the frequency of\nthe signal of the particular radio station in the circuit is maximum. It is important to note that resonance phenomenon is exhibited by a\ncircuit only if both L and C are present in the circuit. Only then do the\nvoltages across L and C cancel each other (both being out of phase)\nand the current amplitude is v /R, the total source voltage appearing\nm\nacross R. This means that we cannot have resonance in a RL or\nRC circuit.", "189\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nExample 7.6 A resistor of 200 W and a capacitor of 15.0 mF are\nconnected in series to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac source.

How to resolve this\nparadox? As you have learnt in the text, the two voltages are not\nin the same phase. Therefore, they cannot be added like ordinary\nnumbers. The two voltages are out of phase by ninety degrees. Therefore, the total of these voltages must be obtained using the\nPythagorean theorem:\nV = V2 +V2\nR+C R C\n= 220 V\nThus, if the phase difference between two voltages is properly taken\ninto account, the total voltage across the resistor and the capacitor\nis equal to the voltage of the source. 190\n6.7\nELPMAXE\n7.7 P AC C : T P F\nOWER IN IRCUIT HE OWER ACTOR\nWe have seen that a voltage v = v sinwt applied to a series RLC circuit\nm\ndrives a current in the circuit given by i = i sin(wt + f) where\nm\nv (cid:230) X - X (cid:246)\ni = m and φ= tan - 1(cid:231) C L(cid:247)\nm Z Ł R ł\nTherefore, the instantaneous power p supplied by the source is\nReprint 2025-26\nAlternating Current\n( ) [ ]\np =vi = v sinw t · i sin(w t+f )\nm m\nv i [ ]\n= m m cosf - cos(2w t+f ) (7.29)\n2\nThe average power over a cycle is given by the average of the two terms in\nR.H.S. of Eq.

If she/he is carrying\nanything made of metal, the metal detector emits a sound. On what\nprinciple does this detector work? Solution The metal detector works on the principle of resonance in\nac circuits. When you walk through a metal detector, you are,\nin fact, walking through a coil of many turns. The coil is connected to\na capacitor tuned so that the circuit is in resonance. When\nyou walk through with metal in your pocket, the impedance of the\ncircuit changes – resulting in significant change in current in the\ncircuit. This change in current is detected and the electronic circuitry\ncauses a sound to be emitted as an alarm. Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n7.8 T\nRANSFORMERS\nFor many purposes, it is necessary to change (or transform) an alternating\nvoltage from one to another of greater or smaller value. This is done with\na device called transformer using the principle of mutual induction. A transformer consists of two sets of coils, insulated from each other. They are wound on a soft-iron core, either one on top of the other as in\nFig. 7.16(a) or on separate limbs of the core as in Fig. 7.16(b). One of the\ncoils called the primary coil has N turns. The other coil is called the\np\nsecondary coil; it has N turns. Often the primary coil is the input coil\ns\nand the secondary coil is the output coil of the transformer.", "FIGURE 7.16 Two arrangements for winding of primary and secondary coil in a transformer:\n(a) two coils on top of each other, (b) two coils on separate limbs of the core. When an alternating voltage is applied to the primary, the resulting\ncurrent produces an alternating magnetic flux which links the secondary\nand induces an emf in it. The value of this emf depends on the number of\nturns in the secondary. We consider an ideal transformer in which the\nprimary has negligible resistance and all the flux in the core links both\nprimary and secondary windings. Let f be the flux in each turn in the core\nat time t due to current in the primary when a voltage v is applied to it. p\nThen the induced emf or voltage e, in the secondary with N turns is\ns s\ndf\ne = - N (7.31)\ns s dt\nThe alternating flux f also induces an emf, called back emf in the\nprimary. This is\ndf\ne = - N (7.32)\np p dt\nBut e = v . If this were not so, the primary current would be infinite\np p\nsince the primary has zero resistance (as assumed). If the secondary is\nan open circuit or the current taken from it is small, then to a good\napproximation\n194\ne = v\ns s\nReprint 2025-26\nAlternating Current\nwhere v is the voltage across the secondary. Therefore, Eqs. (7.31) and\ns\n(7.32) can be written as\ndf\nv = - N\ns s dt [7.31(a)]\ndf\nv = - N\np p dt [7.32(a)]\nFrom Eqs. [7.31 (a)] and [7.32 (a)], we have\nv N\ns = s\n(7.33)\nv N\np p\nNote that the above relation has been obtained using three\nassumptions: (i) the primary resistance and current are small; (ii) the\nsame flux links both the primary and the secondary as very little flux\nescapes from the core, and (iii) the secondary current is small. If the transformer is assumed to be 100% efficient (no energy losses),\nthe power input is equal to the power output, and since p = i v,\ni v = i v (7.34)\np p s s\nAlthough some energy is always lost, this is a good approximation,\nsince a well designed transformer may have an efficiency of more than\n95%. Combining Eqs. (7.33) and (7.34), we have\ni v N\np = s = s\n(7.35)\ni v N\ns p p\nSince i and v both oscillate with the same frequency as the ac source,\nEq. (7.35) also gives the ratio of the amplitudes or rms values of\ncorresponding quantities. Now, we can see how a transformer affects the voltage and current. We have:\n(cid:230) N (cid:246) (cid:230) N (cid:246)\nV s = Ł (cid:231) N s ł (cid:247) V p and I s = Ł (cid:231) N p ł (cid:247) I p (7.36)\np s\nThat is, if the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the\nprimary (N > N ), the voltage is stepped up (V > V ). This type of\ns p s p\narrangement is called a step-up transformer. However, in this arrangement,\nthere is less current in the secondary than in the primary (N /N < 1 and I\np s s\n< I ). For example, if the primary coil of a transformer has 100 turns and\np\nthe secondary has 200 turns, N /N = 2 and N /N =1/2. Thus, a 220V\ns p p s\ninput at 10A will step-up to 440 V output at 5.0 A.", "If the secondary coil has less turns than the primary (N < N ),\ns p\nwe have a step-down transformer. In this case, V < V and I > I . That\ns p s p\nis, the voltage is stepped down, or reduced, and the current\nis increased. The equations obtained above apply to ideal transformers (without\nany energy losses). But in actual transformers, small energy losses do\noccur due to the following reasons:\n(i) Flux Leakage: There is always some flux leakage; that is, not all of\nthe flux due to primary passes through the secondary due to poor 195\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\ndesign of the core or the air gaps in the core. It can be reduced by\nwinding the primary and secondary coils one over the other. (ii)Resistance of the windings: The wire used for the windings has some\nresistance and so, energy is lost due to heat produced in the wire\n(I 2R). In high current, low voltage windings, these are minimised by\nusing thick wire. (iii) Eddy currents: The alternating magnetic flux induces eddy currents\nin the iron core and causes heating. The effect is reduced by using a\nlaminated core. (iv) Hysteresis: The magnetisation of the core is repeatedly reversed by\nthe alternating magnetic field. The resulting expenditure of energy in\nthe core appears as heat and is kept to a minimum by using a magnetic\nmaterial which has a low hysteresis loss. The large scale transmission and distribution of electrical energy over\nlong distances is done with the use of transformers. The voltage output\nof the generator is stepped-up (so that current is reduced and\nconsequently, the I2R loss is cut down). It is then transmitted over long\ndistances to an area sub-station near the consumers. There the voltage\nis stepped down. It is further stepped down at distributing sub-stations\nand utility poles before a power supply of 240 V reaches our homes. SUMMARY\n1. An alternating voltage v =v sin w t applied to a resistor R drives a\nm\nv\ncurrent i = i sinwt in the resistor, i = m . The current is in phase with\nm m R\nthe applied voltage. 2. For an alternating current i = i sin wt passing through a resistor R, the\nm\naverage power loss P (averaged over a cycle) due to joule heating is\n(1/2 )i2R. To express it in the same form as the dc power (P = I2R), a\nm\nspecial value of current is used. It is called root mean square (rms)\ncurrent and is donoted by I:\ni\nI = m =0.707i\nm\n2\nSimilarly, the rms voltage is defined by\nv\nV = m =0.707v\nm\n2\nWe have P = IV = I2R\n3. An ac voltage v = v sin wt applied to a pure inductor L, drives a current\nm\nin the inductor i = i sin (wt – p/2), where i = v /X . X = wL is called\nm m m L L\ninductive reactance. The current in the inductor lags the voltage by\np/2. The average power supplied to an inductor over one complete cycle\nis zero. 196\nReprint 2025-26\nAlternating Current\n4. An ac voltage v = v sinwt applied to a capacitor drives a current in the\nm\ncapacitor: i = i sin (wt + p/2). Here,\nm\nv 1\ni m = X m , X C = w C is called capacitive reactance.", "C\nThe current through the capacitor is p/2 ahead of the applied voltage. As in the case of inductor, the average power supplied to a capacitor\nover one complete cycle is zero. 5. For a series RLC circuit driven by voltage v = v\nm\nsin wt, the current is\ngiven by i = i sin (wt + f)\nm\nv\nwhere i = m\nm\nR2 +\n(\nX - X\n)2\nC L\nX - X\nandf = tan- 1 C L\nR\nZ = R2 +\n(\nX - X\n)2\nis called the impedance of the circuit. C L\nThe average power loss over a complete cycle is given by\nP = V I cosf\nThe term cosf is called the power factor. 6. In a purely inductive or capacitive circuit, cosf = 0 and no power is\ndissipated even though a current is flowing in the circuit. In such cases,\ncurrent is referred to as a wattless current. 7. The phase relationship between current and voltage in an ac circuit\ncan be shown conveniently by representing voltage and current by\nrotating vectors called phasors. A phasor is a vector which rotates\nabout the origin with angular speed w. The magnitude of a phasor\nrepresents the amplitude or peak value of the quantity (voltage or\ncurrent) represented by the phasor. The analysis of an ac circuit is facilitated by the use of a phasor\ndiagram. 8. A transformer consists of an iron core on which are bound a primary\ncoil of N turns and a secondary coil of N turns. If the primary coil is\np s\nconnected to an ac source, the primary and secondary voltages are\nrelated by\n(cid:230) (cid:246)\nN\nV = (cid:231) s(cid:247) V\ns Ł N ł p\np\nand the currents are related by\n(cid:230) N (cid:246)\nI s = Ł (cid:231) N p ł (cid:247) I p\ns\nIf the secondary coil has a greater number of turns than the primary, the\nvoltage is stepped-up (V > V ). This type of arrangement is called a step-\ns p\nup transformer. If the secondary coil has turns less than the primary, we\nhave a step-down transformer. 197\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nPhysical quantity Symbol Dimensions Unit Remarks\nv\nrms voltage V [M L2 T–3 A–1] V V = m , v is the\n2 m\namplitude of the ac voltage. i\nrms current I [ A] A I = m , i is the amplitude of\n2 m\nthe ac current.

When a value is given for ac voltage or current, it is ordinarily the rms\nvalue. The voltage across the terminals of an outlet in your room is\nnormally 240 V. This refers to the rms value of the voltage. The amplitude\nof this voltage is\nv = 2V = 2(240)=340V\nm\n2. The power rating of an element used in ac circuits refers to its average\npower rating. 3. The power consumed in an ac circuit is never negative. 4. Both alternating current and direct current are measured in amperes.", "But how is the ampere defined for an alternating current? It cannot be\nderived from the mutual attraction of two parallel wires carrying ac\n198 currents, as the dc ampere is derived. An ac current changes direction\nReprint 2025-26\nAlternating Current\nwith the source frequency and the attractive force would average to\nzero. Thus, the ac ampere must be defined in terms of some property\nthat is independent of the direction of the current. Joule heating\nis such a property, and there is one ampere of rms value of\nalternating current in a circuit if the current produces the same\naverage heating effect as one ampere of dc current would produce\nunder the same conditions. 5. In an ac circuit, while adding voltages across different elements, one\nshould take care of their phases properly. For example, if V and V\nR C\nare voltages across R and C, respectively in an RC circuit, then the\ntotal voltage across RC combination is V = V2 +V2 and not\nRC R C\nV + V since V is p/2 out of phase of V . R C C R\n6. Though in a phasor diagram, voltage and current are represented by\nvectors, these quantities are not really vectors themselves. They are\nscalar quantities. It so happens that the amplitudes and phases of\nharmonically varying scalars combine mathematically in the same\nway as do the projections of rotating vectors of corresponding\nmagnitudes and directions. The ‘rotating vectors’ that represent\nharmonically varying scalar quantities are introduced only to provide\nus with a simple way of adding these quantities using a rule that\nwe already know as the law of vector addition. 7. There are no power losses associated with pure capacitances and pure\ninductances in an ac circuit. The only element that dissipates energy\nin an ac circuit is the resistive element. 8. In a RLC circuit, resonance phenomenon occur when X = X or\nL C\n1\nw = . For resonance to occur, the presence of both L and C\n0 LC\nelements in the circuit is a must. With only one of these (L or C)\nelements, there is no possibility of voltage cancellation and hence,\nno resonance is possible. 9. The power factor in a RLC circuit is a measure of how close the\ncircuit is to expending the maximum power. 10. In generators and motors, the roles of input and output are\nreversed. In a motor, electric energy is the input and mechanical\nenergy is the output. In a generator, mechanical energy is the\ninput and electric energy is the output. Both devices simply\ntransform energy from one form to another. 11. A transformer (step-up) changes a low-voltage into a high-voltage. This does not violate the law of conservation of energy. The\ncurrent is reduced by the same proportion. 199\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nEXERCISES\n7.1 A 100 W resistor is connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz ac supply.
