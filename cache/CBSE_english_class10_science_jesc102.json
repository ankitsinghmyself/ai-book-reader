["2\nCHAPTER\nAcids, Bases\nand Salts\nYou have learnt in your previous classes that the sour and bitter\ntastes of food are due to acids and bases, respectively, present in them. If someone in the family is suffering from a problem of acidity after\novereating, which of the following would you suggest as a remedy– lemon\njuice, vinegar or baking soda solution? n Which property did you think of while choosing the remedy? Surely you must have used your knowledge about the ability of\nacids and bases to nullify each other’s effect. n Recall how we tested sour and bitter substances without tasting\nthem. You already know that acids are sour in taste and change the colour\nof blue litmus to red, whereas, bases are bitter and change the colour of\nthe red litmus to blue. Litmus is a natural indicator, turmeric is another\nsuch indicator. Have you noticed that a stain of curry on a white cloth\nbecomes reddish-brown when soap, which is basic in nature, is scrubbed\non it? It turns yellow again when the cloth is washed with plenty of\nwater. You can also use synthetic indicators such as methyl orange and\nphenolphthalein to test for acids and bases. In this Chapter, we will study the reactions of acids and bases, how\nacids and bases cancel out each other’s effects and many more interesting\nthings that we use and see in our day-to-day life. ?wonK\nLitmus solution is a purple dye, which is extracted from lichen, a plant belonging to\nthe division Thallophyta, and is commonly used as an indicator. When the litmus\nsolution is neither acidic nor basic, its colour is purple. There are many other natural\nuoY\nmaterials like red cabbage leaves, turmeric, coloured petals of some flowers such as\nHydrangea, Petunia and Geranium, which indicate the presence of acid or base in a\noD solution. These are called acid-base indicators or sometimes simply indicators. Reprint 2025-26\nQ U E S T I O N\n? 1. You have been provided with three test tubes.

In Section 2.1 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical\nproperties. What leads to this similarity in properties?

But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct\nelectricity. Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric\ncurrent through the solution. The electric current is carried through the\nacidic solution by ions. Acids contain H+ ion as cation and anion such as Cl– in HCl, NO– in\n3\nHNO , SO2 –in H SO , CH COO– in CH COOH. Since the cation present in\n3 4 2 4 3 3\nacids is H+, this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions, H+(aq), in\nsolution, which are responsible for their acidic properties. Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide, calcium\nhydroxide, etc. What can you conclude from the results of this Activity? 2.2.1 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution?

We know how acid-base indicators can be used to distinguish between\nan acid and a base. We have also learnt in the previous section about\ndilution and decrease in concentration of H+ or OH– ions in solutions. Can we quantitatively find the amount of these ions present in a solution? Can we judge how strong a given acid or base is? We can do this by making use of a universal indicator, which is a\nmixture of several indicators. The universal indicator shows different\ncolours at different concentrations of hydrogen ions in a solution.", "A scale for measuring hydrogen ion concentration in a solution, called\npH scale has been developed. The p in pH stands for ‘potenz’ in German,\nmeaning power. On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from\n0 (very acidic) to 14 (very alkaline). pH should be thought of simply as a\nnumber which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution. Higher\nthe hydronium ion concentration, lower is the pH value. The pH of a neutral solution is 7. Values less than 7 on the pH scale\nrepresent an acidic solution. As the pH value increases from 7 to 14, it\nrepresents an increase in OH– ion concentration in the solution, that is,\nincrease in the strength of alkali (Fig. 2.6).

It helps in the digestion of food without harming the stomach. During indigestion the stomach produces too much acid and this causes\npain and irritation. To get rid of this pain, people use bases called\nantacids. One such remedy must have been suggested by you at the\nbeginning of this Chapter. These antacids neutralise the excess acid.

When we heat the crystals, this water is removed and the\nof crystallisation\nsalt turns white. If you moisten the crystals again with water, you will find that blue\ncolour of the crystals reappears. Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present\nin one formula unit of a salt. Five water molecules are present in one\nformula unit of copper sulphate. Chemical formula for hydrated copper\nsulphate is Cu SO . 5H O. Now you would be able to answer the question\n4 2\nwhether the molecule of Na CO .10H O is wet. 2 3 2\nOne other salt, which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum. It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation. It has the chemical\nformula CaSO .2H O. Let us look into the use of this salt. 4 2\nPlaster of Paris\nOn heating gypsum at 373 K, it loses water molecules and becomes\n1\ncalcium sulphate hemihydrate (CaSO . H O).

What you have learnt\nn Acid-base indicators are dyes or mixtures of dyes which are used to indicate the\npresence of acids and bases. n Acidic nature of a substance is due to the formation of H+(aq) ions in solution. Formation of OH–(aq) ions in solution is responsible for the basic nature of a\nsubstance. n When an acid reacts with a metal, hydrogen gas is evolved and a corresponding\nsalt is formed. n When a base reacts with a metal, along with the evolution of hydrogen gas a salt is\nformed which has a negative ion composed of the metal and oxygen. n When an acid reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate, it gives\nthe corresponding salt, carbon dioxide gas and water. n Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce\nhydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively. Acids, Bases and Salts 33\nReprint 2025-26\nn The strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using a scale called the pH\nscale (0-14) which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution. n A neutral solution has a pH of exactly 7, while an acidic solution has a pH less\nthan 7 and a basic solution a pH more than 7. n Living beings carry out their metabolic activities within an optimal pH range. n Mixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a highly exothermic process. n Acids and bases neutralise each other to form corresponding salts and water. n Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula\nunit of a salt. n Salts have various uses in everyday life and in industries.
