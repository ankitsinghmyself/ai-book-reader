This principle marks\na departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our\nsystem and causes a gap between the school, home and community.", "The syllabi\nand textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement\nthis basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance\nof sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of\neducation outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and\nteachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to\npursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space,\ntime and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the\ninformation passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as\nthe sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and\nsites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we\nperceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed\nbody of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of\nfunctioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in\nimplementing the annual calender so that the required number of teaching days\nare actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation\nwill also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus\ndesigners have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring\nand reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child\npsychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring\nhands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group\nin science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for\nthis book, Professor B. L. Khandelwal for guiding the work of this committee. Reprint 2025-26\nSeveral teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful\nto their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions\nand organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their\nresources, material and personnel. As an organisation committed to systemic\nreform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT\nwelcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further\nrevision and refinement.", "Director\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\niv\nReprint 2025-26\nR C T\nATIONALISATION OF ONTENT IN THE EXTBOOK\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on\nstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the\ncontent load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative\nmindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to\nrationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed\nby the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-\nlearning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above. v\nReprint 2025-26\nvi\nReprint 2025-26\nP\nREFACE\nChemistry has made a profound impact on the society. It is intimately linked\nto the well-being of human kind. The rate of advancements in chemistry is so\nhigh that curriculum developers continuously look for strategies to cope with\nthese advancements. Also, the students have to be inspired to be the future\nleaders who would make fundamental contributions. The present textbook is\na sincere effort in this direction. The textbook, presented in two parts, comprises of sixteen Units. Although\nthe titles of various Units indicate a sort of compartmentalisation into physical,\ninorganic and organic chemistry, readers will find that these sub-disciplines\nhave been intermingled, at least to a certain extent, to have a unified approach\nto the subject. First nine Units covering physical and inorganic chemistry\nportions are included in Part I while organic chemistry portion comprising of\nseven Units is included in Part II of the book. The approach of presentation\nof the subject matter discourages students from rote memorisation. The subject\nhas in fact, been organised around the laws and principles of chemistry. As\nstudents master these laws and principles, they will soon get to the point\nwhere they can predict much of what will come. Efforts have been directed towards making the subject stimulating and exciting\nby references to the historical developments and its usefulness to our lives,\nwherever appropriate. The text is well illustrated with examples from\nsurrounding environment to facilitate grasping of the qualitative and\nquantitative aspects of the concept easily. Physical data are given in SI units\nthroughout the book to make comparison of various properties easier. IUPAC\nsystem of nomenclature has been followed along with the common names.", "Structural formulae of chemical compounds showing functional/coordinating\ngroups in different colours are drawn using electronic system. Each Unit has\na good number of examples, as illustrations, with their solutions and some\nintext questions, the answers of some of which are given at the end of the Unit. The end of Unit exercises are designed to apply important principles and\nprovoke thinking process to solve them. Answers of some of these exercises\nare given at the end of the book. A variety of materials, e.g., biographical sketches of some scientists, additional\ninformation related to a particular topic, etc., is given in boxes with a deep\nyellow coloured bar. This boxed material with a 'deep yellow bar' is to bring\nadditional life to the topic. However, it is non-evaluative. The structures of\nsome of the more complex compounds incorporated in the book are for\nunderstanding their chemistry. As their reproduction would lead to\nmemorisation, it is also a non-evaluative portion of the text. vii\nReprint 2025-26\nThe information part has been significantly reduced and, wherever possible,\nit has been substantiated with facts. However, it is necessary for students to\nbe aware of commercially important chemicals, their processes of manufacture\nand sources of raw materials. This leads to descriptive material in the book. Attempts have been made to make descriptions of such compounds interesting\nby considering their structures and reactivity. Thermodynamics, kinetics and\nelectrochemical aspects have been applied to a few chemical reactions which\nshould be beneficial to students for understanding why a particular reaction\nhappened and why a particular property is exhibited by the product. There\nis currently great awareness of environmental and energy issues which are\ndirectly related to chemistry. Such issues have been highlighted and dealt\nwith at appropriate places in the book. A team of experts constituted by the NCERT has developed the manuscript of\nthe book. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge the valuable contribution\nof all the members of this team. I also acknowledge the valuable and relentless\ncontribution of the editors in bringing the book to the present shape. I also\nacknowledge with thanks the dedicated efforts and valuable contribution of\nProfessor Brahm Parkash, who not only coordinated the entire programme\nbut also actively involved in writing and editing of this book. Thanks are also\ndue to the participating teachers and subject experts of the review workshop\nfor their contribution, which has helped us to make the book learner friendly. Also, I thank the technical and administrative staff of the NCERT for their\nsupport in the entire process. The team of this textbook development programme hopes that the book\nstimulates its readers and makes them feel the excitement and fascination for\nthis subject. Efforts have been made to bring out this book error-free.", "Nevertheless, it is recognised that in a book of this complexity, there could\ninevitably be occasional errors. It will always be a pleasure to hear about\nthem from readers to take necessary steps to rectify them. B.L.
