Heredity 129\nReprint 2025-26\nGregor Johann Mendel (1822–1884)\nMendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and\nmathematics at the University of Vienna. Failure in the examinations for a\nteaching certificate did not suppress his zeal for scientific quest. He went\nback to his monastery and started growing peas. Many others had studied\nthe inheritance of traits in peas and other organisms earlier, but Mendel\nblended his knowledge of science and mathematics and was the first one\nto keep count of individuals exhibiting a particular trait in each generation. This helped him to arrive at the laws of inheritance. Mendel used a number of contrasting visible characters of garden\npeas – round/wrinkled seeds, tall/short plants, white/violet flowers and\nso on. He took pea plants with different characteristics – a tall plant and\na short plant, produced progeny by crossing them, and calculated the\npercentages of tall or short progeny.", "In the first place, there were no halfway characteristics in this first-\ngeneration, or F1 progeny – no ‘medium-height’ plants. All plants were\ntall. This meant that only one of the parental traits\nwas seen, not some mixture of the two. So the next\nquestion was, were the tall plants in the F1\ngeneration exactly the same as the tall plants of the\nparent generation? Mendelian experiments test this\nby getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall\nplants to reproduce by self-pollination. The progeny\nof the parental plants are, of course, all tall. However,\nthe second-generation, or F2, progeny of the F1 tall\nplants are not all tall. Instead, one quarter of them\nare short. This indicates that both the tallness and\nshortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants, but\nonly the tallness trait was expressed. This led Mendel\nto propose that two copies of factor (now called genes)\ncontrolling traits are present in sexually reproducing\norganism. These two may be identical, or may be\ndifferent, depending on the parentage. A pattern of\ninheritance can be worked out with this assumption,\nas shown in Fig. 8.3. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 88888.....33333\nInheritance of traits\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 88888.....22222\nover two generations\nn In Fig. 8.3, what experiment would we do to confirm that the F2\ngeneration did in fact have a 1:2:1 ratio of TT, Tt and tt trait\ncombinations? In this explanation, both TT and Tt are tall plants, while only tt is a\nshort plant. In other words, a single copy of ‘T’ is enough to make the\nplant tall, while both copies have to be ‘t’ for the plant to be short. Traits\nlike ‘T’ are called dominant traits, while those that behave like ‘t’ are\ncalled recessive traits. Work out which trait would be considered\ndominant and which one recessive in Fig. 8.4. 130 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nWhat happens when pea plants showing two different\ncharacteristics, rather than just one, are bred with each other? What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short\nplant with wrinkled-seeds look like? They are all tall and have\nround seeds. Tallness and round seeds are thus dominant traits. But what happens when these F1 progeny are used to generate\nF2 progeny by self-pollination? A Mendelian experiment will find\nthat some F2 progeny are tall plants with round seeds, and some\nwere short plants with wrinkled seeds. However, there would also\nbe some F2 progeny that showed new combinations. Some of them\nwould be tall, but have wrinkled seeds, while others would be short,\nbut have round seeds. You can see as to how new combinations of FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 88888.....44444\ntraits are formed in F2 offspring when factors controlling for seed\nshape and seed colour recombine to form zygote leading to form x\nF2 offspring (Fig. 8.5).

If progeny plants inherited a of two separate traits,\nshape and colour of seeds\nsingle whole gene set from each parent, then the experiment explained\nin Fig. 8.5 cannot work. This is because the two characteristics ‘R’ and\n‘y’ would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently\nHeredity 131\nReprint 2025-26\ninherited. This is explained by the fact that each gene set is present, not\nas a single long thread of DNA, but as separate independent pieces,\neach called a chromosome. Thus, each cell will have two copies of each\nchromosome, one each from the male and female parents. Every germ-\ncell will take one chromosome from each pair and these may be of either\nmaternal or paternal origin. When two germ cells combine, they will\nrestore the normal number of chromosomes in the progeny, ensuring\nthe stability of the DNA of the species. Such a mechanism of inheritance\nexplains the results of the Mendel experiments, and is used by all\nsexually reproducing organisms.", "But asexually reproducing organisms\nalso follow similar rules of inheritance. Can we work out how their\ninheritance might work? 8.2.4 Sex Determination\nWe have discussed the idea that the two sexes participating in sexual\nreproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number\nof reasons. How is the sex of a newborn individual\ndetermined? Different species use very different strategies\nfor this. Some rely entirely on environmental cues. Thus,\nin some animals like a few reptiles, the temperature at\nwhich fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the\nanimals developing in the eggs will be male or female. In\nother animals, such as snails, individuals can change sex,\nindicating that sex is not genetically determined. However,\nin human beings, the sex of the individual is largely\ngenetically determined. In other words, the genes inherited\nfrom our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls. But so far, we have assumed that similar gene sets are\ninherited from both parents. If that is the case, how can\ngenetic inheritance determine sex? The explanation lies in the fact that all human\nchromosomes are not paired. Most human chromosomes\nhave a maternal and a paternal copy, and we have 22\nsuch pairs. But one pair, called the sex chromosomes, is\nodd in not always being a perfect pair. Women have a\nperfect pair of sex chromosomes, both called X. But men\nhave a mismatched pair in which one is a normal-sized X\nwhile the other is a short one called Y. So women are XX,\nwhile men are XY. Now, can we work out what the\ninheritance pattern of X and Y will be? As Fig. 8.6 shows, half the children will be boys and\nhalf will be girls. All children will inherit an X chromosome\nfrom their mother regardless of whether they are boys or\ngirls. Thus, the sex of the children will be determined by\nwhat they inherit from their father. A child who inherits\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 88888.....66666\nan X chromosome from her father will be a girl, and one\nSex determination in\nhuman beings who inherits a Y chromosome from him will be a boy. 132 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nQ U E S T I O N S\n1.

What you have learnt\nn Variations arising during the process of reproduction can be inherited. n These variations may lead to increased survival of the individuals. n Sexually reproducing individuals have two copies of genes for the same trait.
