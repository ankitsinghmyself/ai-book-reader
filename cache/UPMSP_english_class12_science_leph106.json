["Physics\nChapter Six\nELECTROMAGNETIC\nINDUCTION\n6.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nElectricity and magnetism were considered separate and unrelated\nphenomena for a long time. In the early decades of the nineteenth century,\nexperiments on electric current by Oersted, Ampere and a few others\nestablished the fact that electricity and magnetism are inter-related. They\nfound that moving electric charges produce magnetic fields. For example,\nan electric current deflects a magnetic compass needle placed in its vicinity. This naturally raises the questions like: Is the converse effect possible? Can moving magnets produce electric currents? Does the nature permit\nsuch a relation between electricity and magnetism? The answer is\nresounding yes! The experiments of Michael Faraday in England and\nJoseph Henry in USA, conducted around 1830, demonstrated\nconclusively that electric currents were induced in closed coils when\nsubjected to changing magnetic fields. In this chapter, we will study the\nphenomena associated with changing magnetic fields and understand\nthe underlying principles. The phenomenon in which electric current is\ngenerated by varying magnetic fields is appropriately called\nelectromagnetic induction. When Faraday first made public his discovery that relative motion\nbetween a bar magnet and a wire loop produced a small current in the\nlatter, he was asked, “What is the use of it?” His reply was: “What is the\n154\nuse of a new born baby?” The phenomenon of electromagnetic induction\nReprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\nis not merely of theoretical or academic interest but also\nof practical utility. Imagine a world where there is no\nelectricity – no electric lights, no trains, no telephones and\nno personal computers. The pioneering experiments of\nFaraday and Henry have led directly to the development\nof modern day generators and transformers. Today’s\ncivilisation owes its progress to a great extent to the\ndiscovery of electromagnetic induction. 6.2 T E F\nHE XPERIMENTS OF ARADAY AND\nH\nENRY\nThe discovery and understanding of electromagnetic\ninduction are based on a long series of experiments carried Josheph Henry [1797 –\nout by Faraday and Henry.

Moreover, when the South-pole of\nthe bar magnet is moved towards or away from the\ncoil, the deflections in the galvanometer are opposite\nto that observed with the North-pole for similar\nmovements. Further, the deflection (and hence current)\nis found to be larger when the magnet is pushed\ntowards or pulled away from the coil faster. Instead,\nwhen the bar magnet is held fixed and the coil C is\n1\nmoved towards or away from the magnet, the same\neffects are observed.

It is also observed\nthat the deflection increases dramatically when an iron rod is inserted\ninto the coils along their axis.", "6.3 M F\nAGNETIC LUX\nFaraday’s great insight lay in discovering a simple mathematical relation\nto explain the series of experiments he carried out on electromagnetic\ninduction. However, before we state and appreciate his laws, we must get\nfamiliar with the notion of magnetic flux, F . Magnetic flux is defined in\n156 B\nthe same way as electric flux is defined in Chapter 1. Magnetic flux through\nReprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\na plane of area A placed in a uniform magnetic field B (Fig. 6.4) can\nbe written as\nF = B . A = BA cos q (6.1)\nB\nwhere q is angle between B and A. The notion of the area as a vector\nhas been discussed earlier in Chapter 1. Equation (6.1) can be\nextended to curved surfaces and nonuniform fields. If the magnetic field has different magnitudes and directions at\nvarious parts of a surface as shown in Fig. 6.5, then the magnetic\nflux through the surface is given by\nF = B.dA +B .dA +... = (cid:229) B . dA (6.2)\nB 1 1 2 2 i i\nall\nFIGURE 6.4 A plane of\nwhere ‘all’ stands for summation over all the area elements dA\ni surface area A placed in a\ncomprising the surface and B is the magnetic field at the area element\ni uniform magnetic field B. dA. The SI unit of magnetic flux is weber (Wb) or tesla meter\ni\nsquared (T m2). Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity. 6.4 F ’ L I\nARADAY S AW OF NDUCTION\nFrom the experimental observations, Faraday arrived at a\nconclusion that an emf is induced in a coil when magnetic flux\nthrough the coil changes with time. Experimental observations\ndiscussed in Section 6.2 can be explained using this concept. The motion of a magnet towards or away from coil C in\n1\nExperiment 6.1 and moving a current-carrying coil C towards\n2\nor away from coil C in Experiment 6.2, change the magnetic\n1\nflux associated with coil C . The change in magnetic flux induces\n1\nemf in coil C . It was this induced emf which caused electric\n1\ncurrent to flow in coil C and through the galvanometer. A FIGURE 6.5 Magnetic field B\n1 i\nplausible explanation for the observations of Experiment 6.3 is at the ith area element. dA\ni\nrepresents area vector of the\nas follows: When the tapping key K is pressed, the current in\nith area element. coil C (and the resulting magnetic field) rises from zero to a\n2\nmaximum value in a short time. Consequently, the magnetic\nflux through the neighbouring coil C also increases. It is the change in\n1\nmagnetic flux through coil C that produces an induced emf in coil C . 1 1\nWhen the key is held pressed, current in coil C is constant. Therefore,\n2\nthere is no change in the magnetic flux through coil C and the current in\n1\ncoil C drops to zero. When the key is released, the current in C and the\n1 2\nresulting magnetic field decreases from the maximum value to zero in a\nshort time. This results in a decrease in magnetic flux through coil C\n1\nand hence again induces an electric current in coil C *.", "The common\n1\npoint in all these observations is that the time rate of change of magnetic\nflux through a circuit induces emf in it. Faraday stated experimental\nobservations in the form of a law called Faraday’s law of electromagnetic\ninduction. The law is stated below. * Note that sensitive electrical instruments in the vicinity of an electromagnet\ncan be damaged due to the induced emfs (and the resulting currents) when the\n157\nelectromagnet is turned on or off. Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n158\n1.6\nELPMAXE\nThe magnitude of the induced emf in a circuit is equal\nto the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the\ncircuit. Mathematically, the induced emf is given by\ndF\ne = – B (6.3)\ndt\nThe negative sign indicates the direction of e and hence\nthe direction of current in a closed loop. This will be\ndiscussed in detail in the next section. In the case of a closely wound coil of N turns, change\nof flux associated with each turn, is the same.

EXAMPLE\n6.3\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n6.5 L ’ L C E\nENZ S AW AND ONSERVATION OF NERGY\nIn 1834, German physicist Heinrich Friedrich Lenz (1804-1865) deduced\na rule, known as Lenz’s law which gives the polarity of the induced emf\nin a clear and concise fashion. The statement of the law is:\nThe polarity of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current\nwhich opposes the change in magnetic flux that produced it. The negative sign shown in Eq. (6.3) represents this effect. We can\nunderstand Lenz’s law by examining Experiment 6.1 in Section 6.2.1. In\nFig. 6.1, we see that the North-pole of a bar magnet is being pushed\ntowards the closed coil. As the North-pole of the bar magnet moves towards\nthe coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases. Hence current is\ninduced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux. This is possible only if the current in the coil is in a counter-clockwise\ndirection with respect to an observer situated on the side of the magnet. Note that magnetic moment associated with this current has North polarity\ntowards the North-pole of the approaching magnet.", "Similarly, if the North-\npole of the magnet is being withdrawn from the coil, the magnetic flux\nthrough the coil will decrease. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux,\nthe induced current in the coil flows in clockwise direction and its South-\npole faces the receding North-pole of the bar magnet. This would result in\nan attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the\ncorresponding decrease in flux. What will happen if an open circuit is used in place of the closed loop\nin the above example? In this case too, an emf is induced across the open\nends of the circuit. The direction of the induced emf can be found\nusing Lenz’s law. Consider Figs. 6.6 (a) and (b). They provide an easier\nway to understand the direction of induced currents. Note that the\ndirection shown by and indicate the directions of the induced\ncurrents. A little reflection on this matter should convince us on the\ncorrectness of Lenz’s law. Suppose that the induced current was in\nthe direction opposite to the one depicted in Fig. 6.6(a). In that case,\nthe South-pole due to the induced current will face the approaching\nNorth-pole of the magnet. The bar magnet will then be attracted\ntowards the coil at an ever increasing acceleration. A gentle push on\nthe magnet will initiate the process and its velocity and kinetic energy\nwill continuously increase without expending any energy. If this can\nhappen, one could construct a perpetual-motion machine by a\nsuitable arrangement. This violates the law of conservation of energy\nand hence can not happen. FIGURE 6.6 Now consider the correct case shown in Fig. 6.6(a). In this situation,\nIllustration of the bar magnet experiences a repulsive force due to the induced\nLenz’s law. current. Therefore, a person has to do work in moving the magnet. Where does the energy spent by the person go? This energy is\n160\ndissipated by Joule heating produced by the induced current.

Current can not be induced\nby changing the electric flux. (c) The induced emf is expected to be constant only in the case of the\nrectangular loop. In the case of circular loop, the rate of change of\narea of the loop during its passage out of the field region is not\nconstant, hence induced emf will vary accordingly. (d) The polarity of plate ‘A’ will be positive with respect to plate ‘B’ in\nthe capacitor. 6.6 M E F\nOTIONAL LECTROMOTIVE ORCE\nLet us consider a straight conductor moving in a uniform and time-\nindependent magnetic field. Figure 6.10 shows a rectangular conductor\nPQRS in which the conductor PQ is free to move. The rod PQ is moved\ntowards the left with a constant velocity v as\nshown in the figure. Assume that there is no\nloss of energy due to friction. PQRS forms a\nclosed circuit enclosing an area that changes\nas PQ moves. It is placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B which is perpendicular to the plane of\nthis system. If the length RQ = x and RS = l, the\nmagnetic flux F enclosed by the loop PQRS\nB\nwill be\nF = Blx\nB\nSince x is changing with time, the rate of change\nof flux F will induce an emf given by:\nB\nFIGU s R id E e , 6 . t 1 h 0 u s T d h e e c r a e r a m si n P g Q t h is e m a o re v a e d o t f o t h th e e left e = –dF B = – d ( Blx )\ndt dt\nrectangular loop. This movement\ninduces a current I as shown. dx\n= –Bl = Blv (6.5)\ndt\nReprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\nwhere we have used dx/dt = –v which is the speed of the conductor PQ. The induced emf Blv is called motional emf. Thus, we are able to produce\ninduced emf by moving a conductor instead of varying the magnetic field,\nthat is, by changing the magnetic flux enclosed by the circuit. It is also possible to explain the motional emf expression in Eq. (6.5)\nby invoking the Lorentz force acting on the free charge carriers of conductor\nPQ.", "Consider any arbitrary charge q in the conductor PQ. When the rod\nmoves with speed v, the charge will also be moving with speed v in the\nmagnetic field B. The Lorentz force on this charge is qvB in magnitude,\nand its direction is towards Q. All charges experience the same force, in\nmagnitude and direction, irrespective of their position in the rod PQ. The work done in moving the charge from P to Q is,\nW = qvBl\nSince emf is the work done per unit charge,\nW\ne =\nq\n= Blv\nThis equation gives emf induced across the rod PQ and is identical\nto Eq. (6.5). We stress that our presentation is not wholly rigorous. But\nit does help us to understand the basis of Faraday’s law when\nthe conductor is moving in a uniform and time-independent\nmagnetic field. On the other hand, it is not obvious how an emf is induced when a\nconductor is stationary and the magnetic field is changing – a fact which\nFaraday verified by numerous experiments. In the case of a stationary\nconductor, the force on its charges is given by\nF = q (E + v ····· B) = qE (6.6)\nsince v = 0. Thus, any force on the charge must arise from the electric\nfield term E alone. Therefore, to explain the existence of induced emf or\ninduced current, we must assume that a time-varying magnetic field\ngenerates an electric field. However, we hasten to add that electric fields\nproduced by static electric charges have properties different from those\nproduced by time-varying magnetic fields. In Chapter 4, we learnt that\ncharges in motion (current) can exert force/torque on a stationary magnet. Conversely, a bar magnet in motion (or more generally, a changing\nmagnetic field) can exert a force on the stationary charge. This is the\nfundamental significance of the Faraday’s discovery. Electricity and\nmagnetism are related. Example 6.6 A metallic rod of 1 m length is rotated with a frequency\nof 50 rev/s, with one end hinged at the centre and the other end at the\ncircumference of a circular metallic ring of radius 1 m, about an axis\npassing through the centre and perpendicular to the plane of the ring\n(Fig. 6.11). A constant and uniform magnetic field of 1 T parallel to the\naxis is present everywhere.

Thus, the\nresulting separation of charges produces an emf across the ends of\nthe rod. At a certain value of emf, there is no more flow of electrons\nand a steady state is reached. Using Eq. (6.5), the magnitude of the\nemf generated across a length dr of the rod as it moves at right angles\nto the magnetic field is given by\nde = Bvdr.

These\ntwo situations are described separately in the next two sub-sections. However, in both the cases, the flux through a coil is proportional to the\ncurrent. That is, Φ α I. B\nFurther, if the geometry of the coil does not vary with time then,\ndF dI\nB (cid:181)\ndt dt\nFor a closely wound coil of N turns, the same magnetic flux is linked\nwith all the turns.

Therefore, a term called flux linkage is\nused which is equal to NΦ for a closely wound coil and in such a case\nB\nNΦ (cid:181) I\nB\nThe constant of proportionality, in this relation, is called inductance. We shall see that inductance depends only on the geometry of the coil\nand intrinsic material properties. This aspect is akin to capacitance which\nfor a parallel plate capacitor depends on the plate area and plate separation\n(geometry) and the dielectric constant K of the intervening medium\n(intrinsic material property). Inductance is a scalar quantity. It has the dimensions of [M L2 T–2 A–2]\ngiven by the dimensions of flux divided by the dimensions of current. The\nSI unit of inductance is henry and is denoted by H. It is named in honour\nof Joseph Henry who discovered electromagnetic induction in USA,\nindependently of Faraday in England. 6.7.1 Mutual inductance\nConsider Fig. 6.12 which shows two long co-axial solenoids each of length\nl.

However, the relation is far more general. Note that if the inner solenoid\nwas much shorter than (and placed well inside) the outer solenoid, then\nwe could still have calculated the flux linkage N Φ because the inner\n1 1\nsolenoid is effectively immersed in a uniform magnetic field due to the\nouter solenoid. In this case, the calculation of M would be easy. However,\n12\nit would be extremely difficult to calculate the flux linkage with the outer\nsolenoid as the magnetic field due to the inner solenoid would vary across\nthe length as well as cross section of the outer solenoid. Therefore, the\ncalculation of M would also be extremely difficult in this case.

The magnitude of the induced emf depends upon the rate of change\nof current and mutual inductance of the two coils. 6.7.2 Self-inductance\nIn the previous sub-section, we considered the flux in one solenoid due\nto the current in the other. It is also possible that emf is induced in a\nsingle isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of\nvarying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called\nself-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is\nproportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as\nNF (cid:181) I\nB\nNF = LI (6.13)\nB\nwhere constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It\nis also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current\nis varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced\nin the coil. Using Eq. (6.13), the induced emf is given by\n( )\nd NF\ne = – B\ndt\ndI\ne = –L\n(6.14)\ndt\nThus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change (increase or\ndecrease) of current in the coil. It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple\ngeometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-\nsectional area A and length l, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic\nfield due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ n I (neglecting edge\n0\neffects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is\nNF =(nl)m ( nI )(A)\nB 0\n=µn2AlI\n0\nwhere nl is the total number of turns.", "Thus, the self-inductance is,\nFN\nL = B\nI\n= m n2Al (6.15)\n0\nIf we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability\nµ (for example soft iron, which has a high value of relative permeability),\nr\nthen,\nL = mm n2Al (6.16)\nr 0\nThe self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the\npermeability of the medium. The self-induced emf is also called the back emf as it opposes any\n168 change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays\nReprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\nthe role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics. ε\nSo, work needs to be done against the back emf ( ) in establishing the\ncurrent. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the\ncurrent I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is\ndW\n= e I\ndt\nIf we ignore the resistive losses and consider only inductive effect,\nthen using Eq. (6.14),\ndW dI\n= L I\ndt dt\nTotal amount of work done in establishing the current I is\nI\nW = (cid:242) dW =(cid:242) LIdI\n0\nThus, the energy required to build up the current I is,\n1\nW = LI2 (6.17)\n2\nThis expression reminds us of\nmv2\n/2 for the (mechanical) kinetic energy\nof a particle of mass m, and shows that L is analogous to m (i.e., L is\nelectrical inertia and opposes growth and decay of current in the circuit).

An exceptionally important application is the\ngeneration of alternating currents (ac). The\nmodern ac generator with a typical output\ncapacity of 100 MW is a highly evolved machine. In this section, we shall describe the basic\nprinciples behind this machine. The Yugoslav\ninventor Nicola Tesla is credited with the\ndevelopment of the machine. As was pointed out\nin Section 6.3, one method to induce an emf or\ncurrent in a loop is through a change in the\nloop’s orientation or a change in its effective area. As the coil rotates in a magnetic field B, the\neffective area of the loop (the face perpendicular\nto the field) is A cos q, where q is the angle\nbetween A and B. This method of producing a\nflux change is the principle of operation of a\nReprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\nsimple ac generator. An ac generator converts mechanical energy into\nelectrical energy. The basic elements of an ac generator are shown in Fig. 6.13. It consists\nof a coil mounted on a rotor shaft. The axis of rotation of the coil is\nperpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field. The coil (called\narmature) is mechanically rotated in the uniform magnetic field by some\nexternal means. The rotation of the coil causes the magnetic flux through\nit to change, so an emf is induced in the coil. The ends of the\ncoil are connected to an external circuit by means of slip rings\nand brushes. When the coil is rotated with a constant angular speed w, the angle q\nbetween the magnetic field vector B and the area vector A of the coil at any\ninstant t is q = wt (assuming q = 0° at t = 0). As a result, the effective area\nof the coil exposed to the magnetic field lines changes with time, and from\nEq. (6.1), the flux at any time t is\nF = BA cos q = BA cos wt\nB\nFrom Faraday’s law, the induced emf for the rotating coil of N turns\nis then,\ndF d\ne =–N B =–NBA (cosw t)\ndt dt\nThus, the instantaneous value of the emf is\ne =NBAw swin t (6.19)\nwhere NBAw is the maximum value of the emf, which occurs when\nsin wt = –1. If we denote NBAw as e, then\n0\ne = e sin wt (6.20)\n0\nSince the value of the sine fuction varies between +1 and –1, the sign, or\npolarity of the emf changes with time. Note from Fig. 6.14 that the emf\nhas its extremum value when q = 90° or q = 270°, as the change of flux is\ngreatest at these points. The direction of the current changes periodically and therefore the current\nis called alternating current (ac). Since w = 2pn, Eq (6.20) can be written as\ne = esin 2p n t (6.21)\n0\nwhere n is the frequency of revolution of the generator’s coil. Note that Eq. (6.20) and (6.21) give the instantaneous value of the emf\nand e varies between +e and –e periodically.", "We shall learn how to\n0 0\ndetermine the time-averaged value for the alternating voltage and current\nin the next chapter. In commercial generators, the mechanical energy required for\nrotation of the armature is provided by water falling from a height, for\nexample, from dams. These are called hydro-electric generators. Alternatively, water is heated to produce steam using coal or other\nsources. The steam at high pressure produces the rotation of the\narmature. These are called thermal generators. Instead of coal, if a\nnuclear fuel is used, we get nuclear power generators.

Reprint 2025-26\nElectromagnetic\nInduction\nSUMMARY\n1. The magnetic flux through a surface of area A placed in a uniform magnetic\nfield B is defined as,\nF = B.A = BA cos q\nB\nwhere q is the angle between B and A. 2. Faraday’s laws of induction imply that the emf induced in a coil of N\nturns is directly related to the rate of change of flux through it,\ndF\ne = - N B\ndt\nHere F is the flux linked with one turn of the coil. If the circuit is\nB\nclosed, a current I = e/R is set up in it, where R is the resistance of the\ncircuit. 3. Lenz’s law states that the polarity of the induced emf is such that it\ntends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux\nthat produces it. The negative sign in the expression for Faraday’s law\nindicates this fact. 4. When a metal rod of length l is placed normal to a uniform magnetic\nfield B and moved with a velocity v perpendicular to the field, the\ninduced emf (called motional emf) across its ends is\ne = Bl v\n5. Inductance is the ratio of the flux-linkage to current. It is equal to NF/I. 6. A changing current in a coil (coil 2) can induce an emf in a nearby coil\n(coil 1). This relation is given by,\ndI\ne = - M 2\n1 12 dt\nThe quantity M is called mutual inductance of coil 1 with respect to\n12\ncoil 2. One can similarly define M . There exists a general equality,\n21\nM = M\n12 21\n7.", "When a current in a coil changes, it induces a back emf in the same\ncoil. The self-induced emf is given by,\ndI\ne = - L\ndt\nL is the self-inductance of the coil. It is a measure of the inertia of the\ncoil against the change of current through it. 8. The self-inductance of a long solenoid, the core of which consists of a\nmagnetic material of relative permeability m, is given by\nr\nL = m m n2 Al\nr 0\nwhere A is the area of cross-section of the solenoid, l its length and n\nthe number of turns per unit length. 9. In an ac generator, mechanical energy is converted to electrical energy\nby virtue of electromagnetic induction.

Electricity and magnetism are intimately related. In the early part of the\nnineteenth century, the experiments of Oersted, Ampere and others\nestablished that moving charges (currents) produce a magnetic field. Somewhat later, around 1830, the experiments of Faraday and Henry\ndemonstrated that a moving magnet can induce electric current. 2. In a closed circuit, electric currents are induced so as to oppose the\nchanging magnetic flux. It is as per the law of conservation of energy. However, in case of an open circuit, an emf is induced across its ends. How is it related to the flux change? 3. The motional emf discussed in Section 6.5 can be argued independently\nfrom Faraday’s law using the Lorentz force on moving charges. However,\neven if the charges are stationary [and the q (v × B) term of the Lorentz\nforce is not operative], an emf is nevertheless induced in the presence of a\ntime-varying magnetic field. Thus, moving charges in static field and static\ncharges in a time-varying field seem to be symmetric situation for Faraday’s\nlaw. This gives a tantalising hint on the relevance of the principle of\nrelativity for Faraday’s law.
