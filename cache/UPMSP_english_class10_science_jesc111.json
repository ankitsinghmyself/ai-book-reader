["11\nCHAPTER\nElectricity\nElectricity has an important place in modern society. It is a controllable\nand convenient form of energy for a variety of uses in homes, schools,\nhospitals, industries and so on. What constitutes electricity? How does\nit flow in an electric circuit? What are the factors that control or regulate\nthe current through an electric circuit? In this Chapter, we shall attempt\nto answer such questions. We shall also discuss the heating effect of\nelectric current and its applications. 1111111111.....11111 EEEEELLLLLEEEEECCCCCTTTTTRRRRRIIIIICCCCC CCCCCUUUUURRRRRRRRRREEEEENNNNNTTTTT AAAAANNNNNDDDDD CCCCCIIIIIRRRRRCCCCCUUUUUIIIIITTTTT\nWe are familiar with air current and water current. We know that flowing\nwater constitute water current in rivers. Similarly, if the electric charge\nflows through a conductor (for example, through a metallic wire), we\nsay that there is an electric current in the conductor. In a torch, we\nknow that the cells (or a battery, when placed in proper order) provide\nflow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow. We\nhave also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on. What\ndoes a switch do? A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and\nthe bulb. A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an\nelectric circuit. Now, if the circuit is broken anywhere (or the switch of the\ntorch is turned off), the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow. How do we express electric current? Electric current is expressed by\nthe amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time. In\nother words, it is the rate of flow of electric charges. In circuits using\nmetallic wires, electrons constitute the flow of charges. However, electrons\nwere not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first\nobserved. So, electric current was considered to be the flow of positive\ncharges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the\ndirection of electric current. Conventionally, in an electric circuit the\ndirection of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the\nflow of electrons, which are negative charges. Reprint 2025-26\nIf a net charge Q, flows across any cross-section of a conductor in\ntime t, then the current I, through the cross-section is\nQ\nI = (11.1)\nt\nThe SI unit of electric charge is coulomb (C), which is equivalent to\nthe charge contained in nearly 6 × 1018 electrons. (We know that an\nelectron possesses a negative charge of 1.6 × 10–19 C.) The electric\ncurrent is expressed by a unit called ampere (A), named after the\nFrench scientist, Andre-Marie Ampere (1775–1836). One ampere is\nconstituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second, that is,\n1 A = 1 C/1 s. Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere\n(1 mA = 10–3 A) or in microampere (1 µA = 10–6 A). An instrument called ammeter measures electric\ncurrent in a circuit.", "It is always connected in series\nin a circuit through which the current is to be\nmeasured. Figure 11.1 shows the schematic\ndiagram of a typical electric circuit comprising a\ncell, an electric bulb, an ammeter and a plug key. Note that the electric current flows in the circuit\nfrom the positive terminal of the cell to the negative\nterminal of the cell through the bulb and ammeter.

Let us consider the analogy of\nflow of water. Charges do not flow in a copper wire by themselves, just as\nwater in a perfectly horizontal tube does not flow. If one end of the tube\nis connected to a tank of water kept at a higher level, such that there is a\npressure difference between the two ends of the tube, water flows out of\nthe other end of the tube. For flow of charges in a conducting metallic\nwire, the gravity, of course, has no role to play; the electrons move only\nif there is a difference of electric pressure – called the potential difference –\nalong the conductor. This difference of potential may be produced by a\nbattery, consisting of one or more electric cells. The chemical action within\na cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell,\neven when no current is drawn from it. When the cell is connected to a\nconducting circuit element, the potential difference sets the charges in\nmotion in the conductor and produces an electric current. In order to\nmaintain the current in a given electric circuit, the cell has to expend its\nchemical energy stored in it. We define the electric potential difference between two points in an\nelectric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit\ncharge from one point to the other –\nPotential difference (V) between two points = Work done (W)/Charge (Q)\nV = W/Q (11.2)\nThe SI unit of electric potential difference is volt (V), named after\nAlessandro Volta (1745–1827), an Italian physicist. One volt is the\npotential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor\nwhen 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one\npoint to the other.", "1 joule\nTherefore, 1 volt =\n1 coulomb\n(11.3)\n1 V = 1 J C–1\nThe potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called\nthe voltmeter. The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the\npoints between which the potential difference is to be measured. Example 11.2\nHow much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points\nhaving a potential difference 12 V? Solution\nThe amount of charge Q, that flows between two points at potential\ndifference V (= 12 V) is 2 C. Thus, the amount of work W, done in\nmoving the charge [from Eq. (11.2)] is\nElectricity 173\nReprint 2025-26\nW = VQ\n= 12 V × 2 C\n= 24 J. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. Name a device that helps to maintain a potential difference across a\nconductor. 2.

It is often convenient to draw a schematic diagram, in which different\ncomponents of the circuit are represented by the symbols conveniently\nused.

Electricity 175\nReprint 2025-26\nIn this Activity, you will find that approximately the\nsame value for V/I is obtained in each case. Thus the V–I\ngraph is a straight line that passes through the origin of\nthe graph, as shown in Fig. 11.3. Thus, V/I is a constant\nratio. In 1827, a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm\n(1787–1854) found out the relationship between the current\nI, flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference\nacross its terminals. The potential difference, V, across the\nends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly\nproportional to the current flowing through it, provided its\ntemperature remains the same. This is called Ohm’s law. In\nother words –\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111111111.....33333\nV ∝ I (11.4)\nV–I graph for a nichrome wire. A\nstraight line plot shows that as the or V/I = constant\ncurrent through a wire increases, the = R\npotential difference across the wire or V = IR (11.5)\nincreases linearly – this is Ohm’s law. In Eq. (11.4), R is a constant for the given metallic wire\nat a given temperature and is called its resistance. It is the\nproperty of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it. Its SI\nunit is ohm, represented by the Greek letter Ω. According to Ohm’s law,\nR = V/I (11.6)\nIf the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V\nand the current through it is 1 A, then the resistance R, of the conductor\n1 volt\nis 1 Ω. That is, 1 ohm =\n1 ampere\nAlso from Eq. (11.5) we get\nI = V/R (11.7)\nIt is obvious from Eq. (11.7) that the current through a resistor is\ninversely proportional to its resistance. If the resistance is doubled the\ncurrent gets halved. In many practical cases it is necessary to increase\nor decrease the current in an electric circuit. A component used to\nregulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable\nresistance. In an electric circuit, a device called rheostat is often used to\nchange the resistance in the circuit. We will now study about electrical\nresistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity.

What do the above observations indicate? n You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap. Observe the\nammeter readings in each case. Analyse the observations. In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different\ncomponents. Why do they differ? Certain components offer an easy path\nfor the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow. We know\nthat motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric\ncurrent. The electrons, however, are not completely free to move within a\nconductor. They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among\nwhich they move. Thus, motion of electrons through a conductor is\nretarded by its resistance. A component of a given size that offers a low\nresistance is a good conductor. A conductor having some appreciable\nresistance is called a resistor. A component of identical size that offers a\nhigher resistance is a poor conductor. An insulator of the same size offers\neven higher resistance. 1111111111.....55555 FFFFFAAAAACCCCCTTTTTOOOOORRRRRSSSSS OOOOONNNNN WWWWWHHHHHIIIIICCCCCHHHHH TTTTTHHHHHEEEEE RRRRREEEEESSSSSIIIIISSSSSTTTTTAAAAANNNNNCCCCCEEEEE OOOOOFFFFF AAAAA\nCCCCCOOOOONNNNNDDDDDUUUUUCCCCCTTTTTOOOOORRRRR DDDDDEEEEEPPPPPEEEEENNNNNDDDDDSSSSS\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111111111.....33333\nn Complete an electric circuit consisting of a cell, an ammeter, a nichrome wire of length l\n[say, marked (1)] and a plug key, as shown in Fig. 11.5.

Let the wire be of the same length and same area of cross-section as that of the\nfirst nichrome wire [marked (1)]. Note the value of the current. n Notice the difference in the current in all cases. n Does the current depend on the length of the conductor? n Does the current depend on the area of cross-section of the wire used? It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to one-half when\nthe length of the wire is doubled.", "The ammeter reading is increased when\na thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the\ncircuit. A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different\nmaterial of the same length and the same area of cross-section is used. On applying Ohm’s law [Eqs. (11.5) – (11.7)], we observe that the\nresistance of the conductor depends (i) on its length, (ii) on its area of\ncross-section, and (iii) on the nature of its material. Precise measurements\nhave shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly\nproportional to its length (l) and inversely proportional to the area of\ncross-section (A). That is,\nR ∝ l (11.8)\nand R ∝ 1/A (11.9)\nCombining Eqs. (11.8) and (11.9) we get\nl\nR ∝\nA\nl\nor, R = ρ (11.10)\nA\nwhere ρ (rho) is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical\nresistivity of the material of the conductor. The SI unit of resistivity is\nΩ m. It is a characteristic property of the material. The metals and alloys\n178 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nhave very low resistivity in the range of 10–8 Ω m to 10–6 Ω m. They are\ngood conductors of electricity. Insulators like rubber and glass have\nresistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 Ω m. Both the resistance and\nresistivity of a material vary with temperature. Table 11.2 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher\nthan that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (burn) readily\nat high temperatures. For this reason, they are commonly used in\nelectrical heating devices, like electric iron, toasters etc. Tungsten is used\nalmost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs, whereas copper and\naluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines.

By applying Ohm’s law to the parallel combination of resistors,\nwe have\nI = V/R (11.16)\np\nOn applying Ohm’s law to each resistor, we have\nI = V /R ; I = V /R ; and I = V /R (11.17)\n1 1 2 2 3 3\nFrom Eqs.

Similarly we replace\nthe parallel resistors R , R and R by an equivalent single\n3 4 5\nresistor of resistance R″. Then using Eq. (11.18), we have\n1/ R′ = 1/10 + 1/40 = 5/40; that is R′ = 8 Ω.

Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one\ncomponent fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works. If you have used ‘fairy lights’ to decorate buildings on festivals, on\nmarriage celebrations etc., you might have seen the electrician spending\nlot of time in trouble-locating and replacing the ‘dead’ bulb – each has\nto be tested to find which has fused or gone.

We\nhave also seen, in Section 11.2, that to maintain the current, the source\nhas to keep expending its energy. Where does this energy go? A part of\nthe source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into\nuseful work (like in rotating the blades of an electric fan). Rest of the\nsource energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of\ngadget. We often observe this in our everyday life. For example, an electric\nfan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc. On the other\nhand, if the electric circuit is purely resistive, that is, a configuration of\nresistors only connected to a battery; the source energy continually gets\ndissipated entirely in the form of heat. This is known as the heating\neffect of electric current. This effect is utilised in devices such as electric\nheater, electric iron etc. Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R. Let\nthe potential difference across it be V (Fig. 11.13). Let t be the time during\nwhich a charge Q flows across. The work done in moving the charge Q\nthrough a potential difference V is VQ. Therefore, the source must supply\nenergy equal to VQ in time t. Hence the power input to the circuit by the\nsource is\nQ\nP=V =VI (11.19)\nt\nOr the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P × t,\nthat is, VIt. What happens to this energy expended by the source? This\nenergy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat. Thus for a steady\ncurrent I, the amount of heat H produced in time t is\nH = VIt (11.20)\n188 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nApplying Ohm’s law [Eq.

Calculate the\nheat developed in 30 s. 11.7.1 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of\nElectric Current\nThe generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of\nelectric current. In many cases, it is undesirable as it converts useful\nelectrical energy into heat. In electric circuits, the unavoidable heating\ncan increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties. However, heating effect of electric current has many useful applications. The electric laundry iron, electric toaster, electric oven, electric kettle\nand electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joule’s\nheating. The electric heating is also used to produce light, as in an electric\nbulb. Here, the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is\npossible, so that it gets very hot and emits light. It must not melt at such\nhigh temperature. A strong metal with high melting point such as\ntungsten (melting point 3380°C) is used for making bulb filaments. The\nfilament should be thermally isolated as much as possible, using\ninsulating support, etc. The bulbs are usually filled with chemically\ninactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament. Most of\nthe power consumed by the filament appears as heat, but a small part\nof it is in the form of light radiated. Another common application of Joule’s heating is the fuse used in\nelectric circuits. It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow\nof any unduly high electric current. The fuse is placed in series with\nthe device. It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of\nappropriate melting point, for example aluminium, copper, iron, lead\netc. If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit,\nthe temperature of the fuse wire increases. This melts the fuse wire and\nbreaks the circuit. The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of\nporcelain or similar material with metal ends. The fuses used for domestic\npurposes are rated as 1 A, 2 A, 3 A, 5 A, 10 A, etc. For an electric iron\nwhich consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V, a current\nof (1000/220) A, that is, 4.54 A will flow in the circuit.", "In this case, a 5 A\nfuse must be used. 190 Science\nReprint 2025-26\n1111111111.....88888 EEEEELLLLLEEEEECCCCCTTTTTRRRRRIIIIICCCCC PPPPPOOOOOWWWWWEEEEERRRRR\nYou have studied in your earlier Class that the rate of doing work is\npower.
