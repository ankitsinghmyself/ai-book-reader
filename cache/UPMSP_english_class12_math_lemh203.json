HILBERT\n9.1 Introduction\nIn Class XI and in Chapter 5 of the present book, we\ndiscussed how to differentiate a given function f with respect\nto an independent variable, i.e., how to find f′(x) for a given\nfunction f at each x in its domain of definition. Further, in\nthe chapter on Integral Calculus, we discussed how to find\na function f whose derivative is the function g, which may\nalso be formulated as follows:\nFor a given function g, find a function f such that\ndy\n= g(x), where y = f(x) ... (1)\ndx\nAn equation of the form (1) is known as a differential Henri Poincare\nequation. A formal definition will be given later. (1854-1912 )\nThese equations arise in a variety of applications, may it be in Physics, Chemistry,\nBiology, Anthropology, Geology, Economics etc. Hence, an indepth study of differential\nequations has assumed prime importance in all modern scientific investigations. In this chapter, we will study some basic concepts related to differential equation,\ngeneral and particular solutions of a differential equation, formation of differential\nequations, some methods to solve a first order - first degree differential equation and\nsome applications of differential equations in different areas. 9.2 Basic Concepts\nWe are already familiar with the equations of the type:\nx2 – 3x + 3 = 0 ... (1)\nsin x + cos x = 0 ... (2)\nx + y = 7 ... (3)\nReprint 2025-26\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 301\nLet us consider the equation:\ndy\nx + y = 0 ... (4)\ndx\nWe see that equations (1), (2) and (3) involve independent and/or dependent variable\n(variables) only but equation (4) involves variables as well as derivative of the dependent\nvariable y with respect to the independent variable x. Such an equation is called a\ndifferential equation. In general, an equation involving derivative (derivatives) of the dependent variable\nwith respect to independent variable (variables) is called a differential equation. A differential equation involving derivatives of the dependent variable with respect\nto only one independent variable is called an ordinary differential equation, e.g.,\nd2y dy3\n2 +  = 0 is an ordinary differential equation .... (5)\ndx2 dx\nOf course, there are differential equations involving derivatives with respect to\nmore than one independent variables, called partial differential equations but at this\nstage we shall confine ourselves to the study of ordinary differential equations only. Now onward, we will use the term ‘differential equation’ for ‘ordinary differential\nequation’. A\nNote\n1. We shall prefer to use the following notations for derivatives:\ndy d2y d3y\n= y′, = y′′, = y′′′\ndx dx2 dx3\n2. For derivatives of higher order, it will be inconvenient to use so many dashes\ndny\nas supersuffix therefore, we use the notation y for nth order derivative . n dxn\n9.2.1.", "Order of a differential equation\nOrder of a differential equation is defined as the order of the highest order derivative of\nthe dependent variable with respect to the independent variable involved in the given\ndifferential equation. Consider the following differential equations:\ndy\n= ex ... (6)\ndx\nReprint 2025-26\n302 MATHEMATICS\nd2y\n+ y = 0 ... (7)\ndx2\n3\nd3y d2y\n +x2   = 0 ... (8)\n dx3   dx2 \nThe equations (6), (7) and (8) involve the highest derivative of first, second and\nthird order respectively. Therefore, the order of these equations are 1, 2 and 3 respectively. 9.2.2 Degree of a differential equation\nTo study the degree of a differential equation, the key point is that the differential\nequation must be a polynomial equation in derivatives, i.e., y′, y″, y″′ etc. Consider the\nfollowing differential equations:\nd3y\nd2y2\ndy\n+2  − +y = 0 ... (9)\ndx3  dx2  dx\ndy2 dy\n  + −sin2 y = 0 ... (10)\ndx dx\ndy dy\n+sin  = 0 ... (11)\ndx dx\nWe observe that equation (9) is a polynomial equation in y″′, y″ and y′, equation (10)\nis a polynomial equation in y′ (not a polynomial in y though). Degree of such differential\nequations can be defined. But equation (11) is not a polynomial equation in y′ and\ndegree of such a differential equation can not be defined. By the degree of a differential equation, when it is a polynomial equation in\nderivatives, we mean the highest power (positive integral index) of the highest order\nderivative involved in the given differential equation. In view of the above definition, one may observe that differential equations (6), (7),\n(8) and (9) each are of degree one, equation (10) is of degree two while the degree of\ndifferential equation (11) is not defined. A\nNote Order and degree (if defined) of a differential equation are always\npositive integers.

General and Particular Solutions of a Differential Equation\nIn earlier Classes, we have solved the equations of the type:\nx2 + 1 = 0 ... (1)\nsin2 x – cos x = 0 ...

(3)\ndx2\nIn contrast to the first two equations, the solution of this differential equation is a\nfunction φ that will satisfy it i.e., when the function φ is substituted for the unknown y\n(dependent variable) in the given differential equation, L.H.S. becomes equal to R.H.S.. The curve y = φ (x) is called the solution curve (integral curve) of the given\ndifferential equation. Consider the function given by\ny = φ (x) = a sin (x + b), ... (4)\nwhere a, b ∈ R. When this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3),\nL.H.S. = R.H.S.. So it is a solution of the differential equation (3). π\nLet a and b be given some particular values say a = 2 and b= , then we get a\n4\n π\nfunction y = φ (x) = 2sinx+  ... (5)\n1  4\nWhen this function and its derivative are substituted in equation (3) again\nL.H.S. = R.H.S.. Therefore φ is also a solution of equation (3). 1\nReprint 2025-26\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 305\nFunction φ consists of two arbitrary constants (parameters) a, b and it is called\ngeneral solution of the given differential equation. Whereas function φ contains no\n1\narbitrary constants but only the particular values of the parameters a and b and hence\nis called a particular solution of the given differential equation. The solution which contains arbitrary constants is called the general solution\n(primitive) of the differential equation. The solution free from arbitrary constants i.e., the solution obtained from the general\nsolution by giving particular values to the arbitrary constants is called a particular\nsolution of the differential equation.

The solution which contains as many arbitrary constants as the order of the\ndifferential equation is called a general solution and the solution free from\narbitrary constants is called particular solution.", "®\nVariable separable method is used to solve such an equation in which variables\ncan be separated completely i.e. terms containing y should remain with dy\nand terms containing x should remain with dx. ®\nA differential equation which can be expressed in the form\ndy dx\n= f (x,y) or = g(x,y)where, f (x, y) and g(x, y) are homogenous\ndx dy\nfunctions of degree zero is called a homogeneous differential equation. dy\n®\nA differential equation of the form +Py=Q, where P and Q are constants\ndx\nor functions of x only is called a first order linear differential equation. Historical Note\nOne of the principal languages of Science is that of differential equations. Interestingly, the date of birth of differential equations is taken to be November,\n11,1675, when Gottfried Wilthelm Freiherr Leibnitz (1646 - 1716) first put in black\n1\nand white the identity ∫ydy= y2, thereby introducing both the symbols ∫ and dy. 2\nLeibnitz was actually interested in the problem of finding a curve whose tangents\nwere prescribed. This led him to discover the ‘method of separation of variables’\n1691. A year later he formulated the ‘method of solving the homogeneous\nReprint 2025-26\nDIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 337\ndifferential equations of the first order’. He went further in a very short time\nto the discovery of the ‘method of solving a linear differential equation of the\nfirst-order’. How surprising is it that all these methods came from a single man\nand that too within 25 years of the birth of differential equations! In the old days, what we now call the ‘solution’ of a differential equation, was\nused to be referred to as ‘integral’ of the differential equation, the word being\ncoined by James Bernoulli (1654 - 1705) in 1690. The word ‘solution was first\nused by Joseph Louis Lagrange (1736 - 1813) in 1774, which was almost hundred\nyears since the birth of differential equations. It was Jules Henri Poincare\n(1854 - 1912) who strongly advocated the use of the word ‘solution’ and thus the\nword ‘solution’ has found its deserved place in modern terminology. The name of\nthe ‘method of separation of variables’ is due to John Bernoulli (1667 - 1748),\na younger brother of James Bernoulli. Application to geometric problems were also considered. It was again John\nBernoulli who first brought into light the intricate nature of differential equations. In a letter to Leibnitz, dated May 20, 1715, he revealed the solutions of the\ndifferential equation\nx2 y″ = 2y,\nwhich led to three types of curves, viz., parabolas, hyperbolas and a class of\ncubic curves. This shows how varied the solutions of such innocent looking\ndifferential equation can be. From the second half of the twentieth century attention\nhas been drawn to the investigation of this complicated nature of the solutions of\ndifferential equations, under the heading ‘qualitative analysis of differential\nequations’. Now-a-days, this has acquired prime importance being absolutely\nnecessary in almost all investigations. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
