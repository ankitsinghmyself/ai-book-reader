This principle marks a departure from\nthe legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a\ngap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also\nattempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between\ndifferent subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in\nthe direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy\non Education (1986).", "The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue\nimaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and\nfreedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed\non to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination\nis one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as\nparticipants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than\na source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem\nof curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages\nwith greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this\nbook. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and\nMathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisors for this book, Professor\nP. Sinclair of IGNOU, New Delhi and Professor G.P. Dikshit (Retd.) of Lucknow\nUniversity, Lucknow for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers\nReprint 2025-26\niv\ncontributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals\nfor making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which\nhave generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,\nappointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human\nResource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and\nProfessor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement.", "Director\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n15 November 2006 Research and Training\nReprint 2025-26\nRationalisation of Content in the Textbooks\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on\nstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content\nload and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In\nthis background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks\nacross all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across\nclasses have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from\nteachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes\ngiven above. Reprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\nPreface\nThrough the years, from the time of the Kothari Commission, there have been\nseveral committees looking at ways of making the school curriculum meaningful\nand enjoyable for the learners. Based on the understanding developed over the\nyears, a National Curriculum Framework (NCF) was finalised in 2005. As part of\nthis exercise, a National Focus Group on Teaching of Mathematics was formed. Its\nreport, which came in 2005, highlighted a constructivist approach to the teaching\nand learning of mathematics. The essence of this approach is that children already know, and do some\nmathematics very naturally in their surroundings, before they even join school. The\nsyllabus, teaching approach, textbooks etc., should build on this knowledge in a way\nthat allows children to enjoy mathematics, and to realise that mathematics is more\nabout a way of reasoning than about mechanically applying formulae and algorithms. The students and teachers need to perceive mathematics as something natural and\nlinked to the world around us. While teaching mathematics, the focus should be on\nhelping children to develop the ability to particularise and generalise, to solve and\npose meaningful problems, to look for patterns and relationships, and to apply the\nlogical thinking behind mathematical proof. And, all this in an environment that the\nchildren relate to, without overloading them. This is the philosophy with which the mathematics syllabus from Class I to\nClass XII was developed, and which the textbook development committee has tried\nto realise in the present textbook. More specifically, while creating the textbook, the\nfollowing broad guidelines have been kept in mind. l The matter needs to be linked to what the child has studied before, and to\nher experiences.", "l The language used in the book, including that for ‘word problems’, must be\nclear, simple and unambiguous. l Concepts/processes should be introduced through situations from the\nchildren’s environment. l For each concept/process give several examples and exercises, but not of\nthe same kind. This ensures that the children use the concept/process again\nand again, but in varying contexts. Here ‘several’ should be within reason,\nnot overloading the child. l Encourage the children to see, and come out with, diverse solutions to\nproblems. Reprint 2025-26\nviii\nl As far as possible, give the children motivation for results used. l All proofs need to be given in a non-didactic manner, allowing the learner to\nsee the flow of reason. The focus should be on proofs where a short and\nclear argument reinforces mathematical thinking and reasoning. l Whenever possible, more than one proof is to be given. l Proofs and solutions need to be used as vehicles for helping the learner\ndevelop a clear and logical way of expressing her arguments. l All geometric constructions should be accompanied by an analysis of the\nconstruction and a proof for the steps taken to do the required construction. Accordingly, the children would be trained to do the same while doing\nconstructions. l Add such small anecdotes, pictures, cartoons and historical remarks at\nseveral places which the children would find interesting. l Include optional exercises for the more interested learners. These would\nnot be tested in the examinations. l Give answers to all exercises, and solutions/hints for those that the children\nmay require. l Whenever possible, propagate constitutional values. As you will see while studying this textbook, these points have been kept in mind\nby the Textbook Development Committee. The book has particularly been created\nwith the view to giving children space to explore mathematics and develop the abilities\nto reason mathematically. Further, two special appendices have been given — Proofs\nin Mathematics, and Mathematical Modelling. These are placed in the book for\ninterested students to study, and are only optional reading at present. These topics\nmay be considered for inclusion in the main syllabi in due course of time. As in the past, this textbook is also a team effort. However, what is unusual\nabout the team this time is that teachers from different kinds of schools have been\nan integral part at each stage of the development. We are also assuming that teachers\nwill contribute continuously to the process in the classroom by formulating examples\nand exercises contextually suited to the children in their particular classrooms. Finally,\nwe hope that teachers and learners would send comments for improving the textbook\nto the NCERT. PARVIN SINCLAIR\nG.P.
