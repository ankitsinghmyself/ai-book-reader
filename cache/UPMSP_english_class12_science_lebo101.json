It is generally surrounded by four wall layers (Figure\n1.3b)– the epidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum. The\nouter three wall layers perform the function of protection and help in\ndehiscence of anther to release the pollen. The innermost wall layer is\nthe tapetum.

Pollen grains are generally spherical measuring about\n25-50 micrometers in diameter. It has a prominent two-layered\nwall. The hard outer layer called the exine is made up of\nsporopollenin which is one of the most resistant organic material\nknown. It can withstand high temperatures and strong acids\nand alkali. No enzyme that degrades sporopollenin is so far\nknown. Pollen grain exine has prominent apertures called germ\npores where sporopollenin is absent.

You may have heard of storing semen/\nsperms of many animals including humans for artificial insemination. It\nis possible to store pollen grains of a large number of species for years in\nliquid nitrogen (-1960C). Such stored pollen can be used as pollen banks,\nsimilar to seed banks, in crop breeding programmes. 1.2.2 The Pistil, Megasporangium (ovule) and Embryo sac\nThe gynoecium represents the female reproductive part of the flower. The\ngynoecium may consist of a single pistil (monocarpellary) or may have\nmore than one pistil (multicarpellary). When there are more than one,\n8 the pistils may be fused together (syncarpous) (Figure 1.7b) or may be\nfree (apocarpous) (Figure 1.7c). Each pistil has three parts (Figure 1.7a),\nthe stigma, style and ovary. The stigma serves as a landing platform\nfor pollen grains. The style is the elongated slender part beneath the\nstigma. The basal bulged part of the pistil is the ovary. Inside the ovary\nis the ovarian cavity (((((locule). The placenta is located inside the ovarian\ncavity.

Arising from the placenta are the megasporangia, commonly\ncalled ovules. The number of ovules in an ovary may be one (wheat,\npaddy, mango) to many (papaya, water melon, orchids). The Megasporangium (Ovule) : Let us familiarise ourselves with the\nstructure of a typical angiosperm ovule (Figure 1.7d). The ovule is a small\nstructure attached to the placenta by means of a stalk called funicle. The body of the ovule fuses with funicle in the region called hilum. Thus,\nhilum represents the junction between ovule and funicle. Each ovule has\none or two protective envelopes called integuments. Integuments encircle\nthe nucellus except at the tip where a small opening called the micropyle\nis organised. Opposite the micropylar end, is the chalaza, representing\nthe basal part of the ovule. Enclosed within the integuments is a mass of cells called the nucellus. 9\nCells of the nucellus have abundant reserve food materials. Located in the\nnucellus is the embryo sac or female gametophyte. An ovule generally has\na single embryo sac formed from a megaspore. Megasporogenesis : The process of formation of megaspores from the\nmegaspore mother cell is called megasporogenesis.", "Ovules generally\ndifferentiate a single megaspore mother cell (MMC) in the micropylar region\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\nFigure 1.8 (a) Parts of the ovule showing a large megaspore mother cell, a dyad and a tetrad of\nmegaspores; (b) 2, 4, and 8-nucleate stages of embryo sac and a mature embryo sac; (c) A\ndiagrammatic representation of the mature embryo sac. of the nucellus.

(Figure 1.8b). The nucleus of the functional megaspore divides mitotically\nto form two nuclei which move to the opposite poles, forming the 2-\nnucleate embryo sac. Two more sequential mitotic nuclear divisions\nresult in the formation of the 4-nucleate and later the 8-nucleate stages\nof the embryo sac. It is of interest to note that these mitotic divisions are\nstrictly free nuclear, that is, nuclear divisions are not followed immediately\nby cell wall formation. After the 8-nucleate stage, cell walls are laid down\nleading to the organisation of the typical female gametophyte\nor embryo sac. Observe the distribution of cells inside the embryo sac\n(Figure 1.8b, c). Six of the eight nuclei are surrounded by cell walls and\norganised into cells; the remaining two nuclei, called polar nuclei are\nsituated below the egg apparatus in the large central cell. There is a characteristic distribution of the cells within the embryo\nsac. Three cells are grouped together at the micropylar end and constitute\nthe egg apparatus. The egg apparatus, in turn, consists of two synergids\nand one egg cell. The synergids have special cellular thickenings at the\nmicropylar tip called filiform apparatus, which play an important role in\nguiding the pollen tubes into the synergid. Three cells are at the chalazal\nend and are called the antipodals. The large central cell, as mentioned\nearlier, has two polar nuclei. Thus, a typical angiosperm embryo sac, at\nmaturity, though 8-nucleate is 7-celled. 1.2.3 Pollination\nIn the preceding sections you have learnt that the male and female gametes\nin flowering plants are produced in the pollen grain and embryo sac,\nrespectively. As both types of gametes are non-motile, they have to be\nbrought together for fertilisation to occur. How is this achieved?", "Pollination is the mechanism to achieve this objective. Transfer\nof pollen grains (shed from the anther) to the stigma of a pistil is\ntermed pollination. Flowering plants have evolved an amazing array\nof adaptations to achieve pollination. They make use of external\nagents to achieve pollination. Can you list the possible external\nagents? Kinds of Pollination : Depending on the source of pollen, pollination\ncan be divided into three types. 11\n(i) AAAAAuuuuutttttooooogggggaaaaammmmmyyyyy : In this type, pollination is achieved within the same\nflower. Transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the\nsame flower (Figure 1.9a). In a normal flower which opens and\nexposes the anthers and the stigma, complete autogamy is rather\nrare. Autogamy in such flowers requires synchrony in pollen release\nand stigma receptivity and also, the anthers and the stigma should\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nlie close to each other so that self-pollination\ncan occur. Some plants such as Viola\n(common pansy), Oxalis, and Commelina\nproduce two types of flowers –\nchasmogamous flowers which are similar to\nflowers of other species with exposed anthers\nand stigma, and cleistogamous flowers which\ndo not open at all (Figure 1.9c). In such flowers,\nthe anthers and stigma lie close to each other. (a) When anthers dehisce in the flower buds,\npollen grains come in contact with the stigma\nto effect pollination. Thus, cleistogamous\nflowers are invariably autogamous as there is\nno chance of cross-pollen landing on the\nstigma. Cleistogamous flowers produce\nassured seed-set even in the absence of\npollinators. Do you think that cleistogamy is\nadvantageous or disadvantageous to the\nplant? Why? (b) (ii) GGGGGeeeeeiiiiitttttooooonnnnnooooogggggaaaaammmmmyyyyy – Transfer of pollen grains from\nthe anther to the stigma of another flower of\nthe same plant. Although geitonogamy is\nfunctionally cross-pollination involving a\npollinating agent, genetically it is similar to\nautogamy since the pollen grains come from\nthe same plant. (iii) XXXXXeeeeennnnnooooogggggaaaaammmmmyyyyy – Transfer of pollen grains from\nanther to the stigma of a different plant (Figure\n1.9b). This is the only type of pollination which\nduring pollination brings genetically different\ntypes of pollen grains to the stigma. Agents of Pollination : Plants use two abiotic (wind\nand water) and one biotic (animals) agents to achieve\npollination. Majority of plants use biotic agents for\npollination. Only a small proportion of plants use\n12\n(c) abiotic agents. Pollen grains coming in contact with\nthe stigma is a chance factor in both wind and water\npollination. To compensate for this uncertainties and\nassociated loss of pollen grains, the flowers produce\nFigure 1.9 (a) Self-pollinated flowers;\n(b)Cross pollinated flowers; enormous amount of pollen when compared to the\n(c)Cleistogamous flowers\nnumber of ovules available for pollination.", "Reprint 2025-26\nHSEX\nU\nU\nM\nA\nA\nL\nN\nR REP\nE\nR\nP\nO\nR\nD\nO\nU\nD\nC\nU\nT\nC\nIO\nT\nN\nIO\nI\nN\nN FLOWERING PLANTS\nPollination by wind is more common\namongst abiotic pollinations. Wind pollination\nalso requires that the pollen grains are light\nand non-sticky so that they can be\ntransported in wind currents. They often\npossess well-exposed stamens (so that the\npollens are easily dispersed into wind currents,\nFigure 1.10) and large often-feathery stigma\nto easily trap air-borne pollen grains. Wind-\npollinated flowers often have a single ovule in\neach ovary and numerous flowers packed into\nan inflorescence; a familiar example is the corn\ncob – the ears you see are nothing but the\nstigma and style which wave in the wind to\ntrap pollen grains. Wind-pollination is quite\ncommon in grasses. Pollination by water is quite rare in\nflowering plants and is limited to about 30\ngenera, mostly monocotyledons. As against\nthis, you would recall that water is a regular\nmode of transport for the male gametes among\nthe lower plant groups such as algae,\nbryophytes and pteridophytes. It is believed,\nparticularly for some bryophytes and Figure 1.10 A wind-pollinated plant showing\ncompact inflorecence and well-\npteridophytes, that their distribution is limited\nexposed stamens\nbecause of the need for water for the transport\nof male gametes and fertilisation. Some\nexamples of water pollinated plants are Vallisneria and Hydrilla which\ngrow in fresh water and several marine sea-grasses such as Zostera. Not\nall aquatic plants use water for pollination. In a majority of aquatic plants\nsuch as water hyacinth and water lily, the flowers emerge above the level\nof water and are pollinated by insects or wind as in most of the land\nplants. In Vallisneria, the female flower reach the surface of water by the\nlong stalk and the male flowers or pollen grains are released on to the\nsurface of water. They are carried passively by water currents (Figure\n1.11a); some of them eventually reach the female flowers and the stigma. In another group of water pollinated plants such as seagrasses, female\nflowers remain submerged in water and the pollen grains are released 13\ninside the water. Pollen grains in many such species are long, ribbon like\nand they are carried passively inside the water; some of them reach the\nstigma and achieve pollination. In most of the water-pollinated species,\npollen grains are protected from wetting by a mucilaginous covering. Both wind and water pollinated flowers are not very colourful and do\nnot produce nectar. What would be the reason for this? Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nMajority of flowering plants use\na range of animals as pollinating\nagents. Bees, butterflies, flies,\nbeetles, wasps, ants, moths, birds\n(sunbirds and humming birds) and\nbats are the common pollinating\nagents. (Figure 1.11b). Among the\nanimals, insects, particularly bees\nare the dominant biotic pollinating\nagents.", "Even larger animals such\nas some primates (lemurs), arboreal\n(tree-dwelling) rodents, or even\nreptiles (gecko lizard and garden\nlizard) have also been reported as\npollinators in some species. Often flowers of animal-\n(a)\npollinated plants are specifically\nadapted for a particular species of\nanimal. Majority of insect-pollinated\nflowers are large, colourful, fragrant\nand rich in nectar. When the flowers\nare small, a number of flowers are\nclustered into an inflorescence to\nmake them conspicuous. Animals\nare attracted to flowers by colour\nand/or fragrance. The flowers\npollinated by flies and beetles\nsecrete foul odours to attract these\nanimals. To sustain animal visits,\nthe flowers have to provide rewards\nto the animals. Nectar and pollen\ngrains are the usual floral rewards. For harvesting the reward(s) from\n(b)\nthe flower the animal visitor comes\nFigure 1.11 (a) Pollination by water in Vallisneria; in contact with the anthers and the\n(b) Insect pollination stigma. The body of the animal gets\na coating of pollen grains, which are\n14 generally sticky in animal pollinated flowers. When the animal carrying\npollen on its body comes in contact with the stigma, it brings about\npollination. In some species floral rewards are in providing safe places to lay eggs;\nan example is that of the tallest flower of Amorphophallus (the flower\nitself is about 6 feet in height). A similar relationship exists between a\nspecies of moth and the plant Yucca where both species – moth and the\nReprint 2025-26\nHSEX\nU\nU\nM\nA\nA\nL\nN\nR REP\nE\nR\nP\nO\nR\nD\nO\nU\nD\nC\nU\nT\nC\nIO\nT\nN\nIO\nI\nN\nN FLOWERING PLANTS\nplant – cannot complete their life cycles without each other. The moth\ndeposits its eggs in the locule of the ovary and the flower, in turn, gets\npollinated by the moth. The larvae of the moth come out of the eggs as\nthe seeds start developing. Why don’t you observe some flowers of the following plants (or any\nothers available to you): Cucumber, Mango, Peepal, Coriander, Papaya,\nOnion, Lobia, Cotton, Tobacco, Rose, Lemon, Eucalyptus, Banana? Try to\nfind out which animals visit them and whether they could be\npollinators.You’ll have to patiently observe the flowers over a few days\nand at different times of the day. You could also try to see whether there\nis any correlation in the characteristics of a flower to the animal that\nvisits it. Carefully observe if any of the visitors come in contact with the\nanthers and the stigma as only such visitors can bring about pollination. Many insects may consume pollen or the nectar without bringing about\npollination. Such floral visitors are referred to as pollen/nectar robbers. You may or may not be able to identify the pollinators, but you will surely\nenjoy your efforts! Outbreeding Devices : Majority of flowering plants produce hermaphrodite\nflowers and pollen grains are likely to come in contact with the stigma of\nthe same flower. Continued self-pollination result in inbreeding depression.", "Flowering plants have developed many devices to discourage self-\npollination and to encourage cross-pollination. In some species, pollen\nrelease and stigma receptivity are not synchronised. Either the pollen is\nreleased before the stigma becomes receptive or stigma becomes receptive\nmuch before the release of pollen. In some other species, the anther and\nstigma are placed at different positions so that the pollen cannot come in\ncontact with the stigma of the same flower. Both these devices prevent\nautogamy. The third device to prevent inbreeding is self-incompatibility. This is a genetic mechanism and prevents self-pollen (from the same flower\nor other flowers of the same plant) from fertilising the ovules by inhibiting\npollen germination or pollen tube growth in the pistil. Another device to\nprevent self-pollination is the production of unisexual flowers. If both male\nand female flowers are present on the same plant such as castor and maize\n(monoecious), it prevents autogamy but not geitonogamy. In several species\nsuch as papaya, male and female flowers are present on different plants,\nthat is each plant is either male or female (dioecy). This condition prevents\nboth autogamy and geitonogamy. Pollen-pistil Interaction : Pollination does not guarantee the transfer 15\nof the right type of pollen (compatible pollen of the same species as the\nstigma). Often, pollen of the wrong type, either from other species or from\nthe same plant (if it is self-incompatible), also land on the stigma. The\npistil has the ability to recognise the pollen, whether it is of the right type\n(compatible) or of the wrong type (incompatible). If it is of the right type,\nthe pistil accepts the pollen and promotes post-pollination events that\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n(a)\n(b) (c)\n(e)\n(d)\nFigure 1.12 (a) Pollen grains germinating on the stigma; (b) Pollen tubes growing through the\nstyle; (c) L.S. of pistil showing path of pollen tube growth; (d) enlarged view of an\negg apparatus showing entry of pollen tube into a synergid; (e) Discharge of male\ngametes into a synergid and the movements of the sperms, one into the egg and\nthe other into the central cell\nleads to fertilisation. If the pollen is of the wrong type, the pistil rejects the\npollen by preventing pollen germination on the stigma or the pollen tube\ngrowth in the style. The ability of the pistil to recognise the pollen followed\nby its acceptance or rejection is the result of a continuous dialogue\nbetween pollen grain and the pistil. This dialogue is mediated by chemical\n16 components of the pollen interacting with those of the pistil. It is only in\nrecent years that botanists have been able to identify some of the pollen\nand pistil components and the interactions leading to the recognition,\nfollowed by acceptance or rejection.

In such plants, the generative cell divides and\nforms the two male gametes during the growth of pollen tube in the stigma. In plants which shed pollen in the three-celled condition, pollen tubes\ncarry the two male gametes from the beginning. Pollen tube, after reaching\nthe ovary, enters the ovule through the micropyle and then enters one of\nthe synergids through the filiform apparatus (Figure 1.12d, e). Many recent\nstudies have shown that filiform apparatus present at the micropylar part\nof the synergids guides the entry of pollen tube. All these events–from\npollen deposition on the stigma until pollen tubes enter the ovule–are\ntogether referred to as pollen-pistil interaction. As pointed out earlier,\npollen-pistil interaction is a dynamic process involving pollen recognition\nfollowed by promotion or inhibition of the pollen. The knowledge gained\nin this area would help the plant breeder in manipulating pollen-pistil\ninteraction, even in incompatible pollinations, to get desired hybrids. You can easily study pollen germination by dusting some pollen from\nflowers such as pea, chickpea, Crotalaria, balsam and Vinca on a glass slide\ncontaining a drop of sugar solution (about 10 per cent). After about 15–30\nminutes, observe the slide under the low power lens of the microscope. You\nare likely to see pollen tubes coming out of the pollen grains. A breeder is interested in crossing different species and often genera\nto combine desirable characters to produce commercially ‘superior’\nvarieties. Artificial hybridisation is one of the major approaches of crop\nimprovement programme. In such crossing experiments it is important\nto make sure that only the desired pollen grains are used for pollination\nand the stigma is protected from contamination (from unwanted pollen). This is achieved by emasculation and bagging techniques. If the female parent bears bisexual flowers, removal of anthers from\nthe flower bud before the anther dehisces using a pair of forceps is\nnecessary. This step is referred to as emasculation. Emasculated flowers\nhave to be covered with a bag of suitable size, generally made up of butter\npaper, to prevent contamination of its stigma with unwanted pollen. This\nprocess is called bagging. When the stigma of bagged flower attains\nreceptivity, mature pollen grains collected from anthers of the male parent\n17\nare dusted on the stigma, and the flowers are rebagged, and the fruits\nallowed to develop. If the female parent produces unisexual flowers, there is no need for\nemasculation. The female flower buds are bagged before the flowers open.", "When the stigma becomes receptive, pollination is carried out using the\ndesired pollen and the flower rebagged. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n1.3 D F\nOUBLE ERTILISATION\nAfter entering one of the synergids, the pollen tube releases the two male\ngametes into the cytoplasm of the synergid. One of the male gametes moves\ntowards the egg cell and fuses with its nucleus thus completing the\nsyngamy. This results in the formation of a diploid cell, the zygote. The\nother male gamete moves towards the two polar nuclei located in the central\ncell and fuses with them to produce a triploid primary endosperm nucleus\n(PEN) (Figure 1.13a). As this involves the fusion of three haploid nuclei it\nis termed triple fusion. Since two types of fusions, syngamy and triple\nfusion take place in an embryo sac the phenomenon is termed double\nfertilisation, an event unique to flowering plants. The central cell after\ntriple fusion becomes the primary endosperm cell (PEC) and develops\ninto the endosperm while the zygote develops into an embryo.

The cells of this tissue are filled with\nreserve food materials and are used for the nutrition of\nthe developing embryo. In the most common type of\nendosperm development, the PEN undergoes successive\nnuclear divisions to give rise to free nuclei. This stage of\nendosperm development is called free-nuclear endosperm. Subsequently cell wall formation occurs and the\nendosperm becomes cellular. The number of free nuclei\nformed before cellularisation varies greatly. The coconut\nwater from tender coconut that you are familiar with, is\nnothing but free-nuclear endosperm (made up of\nthousands of nuclei) and the surrounding white kernel is\nthe cellular endosperm. Endosperm may either be completely consumed by the\n(a)\ndeveloping embryo (e.g., pea, groundnut, beans) before seed\nmaturation or it may persist in the mature seed (e.g. castor\nand coconut) and be used up during seed germination. Split\nopen some seeds of castor, peas, beans, groundnut, fruit of\ncoconut and look for the endosperm in each case. Find out\nwhether the endosperm is persistent in cereals – wheat, rice\nand maize. 1.4.2 Embryo\nEmbryo develops at the micropylar end of the embryo sac where\nthe zygote is situated. Most zygotes divide only after certain\namount of endosperm is formed.", "This is an adaptation to\nprovide assured nutrition to the developing embryo. Though\nthe seeds differ greatly, the early stages of embryo development\n(embryogeny) are similar in both monocotyledons and\ndicotyledons. Figure 1.13 depicts the stages of embryogeny in\na dicotyledonous embryo. The zygote gives rise to the\nproembryo and subsequently to the globular, heart-shaped\nand mature embryo. (b)\nA typical dicotyledonous embryo (Figure 1.14a), consists\nof an embryonal axis and two cotyledons. The portion of Figure 1.14 (a) A typical dicot\nembryonal axis above the level of cotyledons is the epicotyl, embryo; (b) L.S. of an\nembryo of grass\nwhich terminates with the plumule or stem tip. The cylindrical\nportion below the level of cotyledons is hypocotyl that\n19\nterminates at its lower end in the radicle or root tip. The root\ntip is covered with a root cap. Embryos of monocotyledons (Figure 1.14 b) possess only\none cotyledon. In the grass family the cotyledon is called\nscutellum that is situated towards one side (lateral) of the\nembryonal axis. At its lower end, the embryonal axis has the\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nradical and root cap enclosed in an undifferentiated sheath called\ncoleorrhiza. The portion of the embryonal axis above the level of\nattachment of scutellum is the epicotyl. Epicotyl has a shoot apex and a\nfew leaf primordia enclosed in a hollow foliar structure, the coleoptile. Soak a few seeds in water (say of wheat, maize, peas, chickpeas,\nground nut) overnight. Then split the seeds and observe the various\nparts of the embryo and the seed. 1.4.3 Seed\nIn angiosperms, the seed is the final product of sexual reproduction. It is\noften described as a fertilised ovule. Seeds are formed inside fruits. A\nseed typically consists of seed coat(s), cotyledon(s) and an embryo axis. The cotyledons (Figure 1.15a) of the embryo are simple structures,\ngenerally thick and swollen due to storage of food reserves (as in legumes). Mature seeds may be non-albuminous or ex-albuminous. Non-\nalbuminous seeds have no residual endosperm as it is completely\nconsumed during embryo development (e.g., pea, groundnut). Albuminous seeds retain a part of endosperm as it is not completely used\nup during embryo development (e.g., wheat, maize, barley, castor). Occasionally, in some seeds such as black pepper and beet, remnants of\nnucellus are also persistent. This residual, persistent nucellus is the\nperisperm. Integuments of ovules harden as tough protective seed coats\n(Figure 1.15a). The micropyle remains as a small pore in the seed coat. This facilitates entry of oxygen and water into the seed during germination. As the seed matures, its water content is reduced and seeds become\nrelatively dry (10-15 per cent moisture by mass). The general metabolic\nactivity of the embryo slows down. The embryo may enter a state of\ninactivity called dormancy, or if favourable conditions are available\n(adequate moisture, oxygen and suitable temperature), they germinate.", "As ovules mature into seeds, the ovary develops into a fruit, i.e., the\ntransformation of ovules into seeds and ovary into fruit proceeds\nsimultaneously. The wall of the ovary develops into the wall of fruit called\npericarp. The fruits may be fleshy as in guava, orange, mango, etc., or\nmay be dry, as in groundnut, and mustard, etc. Many fruits have evolved\nmechanisms for dispersal of seeds. Recall the classification of fruits and\ntheir dispersal mechanisms that you have studied in an earlier class. Is\nthere any relationship between number of ovules in an ovary and the\n20\nnumber of seeds present in a fruit? In most plants, by the time the fruit develops from the ovary, other\nfloral parts degenerate and fall off. However, in a few species such as apple,\nstrawberry, cashew, etc., the thalamus also contributes to fruit formation. Such fruits are called false fruits (Figure 1.15b). Most fruits however\ndevelop only from the ovary and are called true fruits. Although in most\nof the species, fruits are the results of fertilisation, there are a few species\nReprint 2025-26\nHSEX\nU\nU\nM\nA\nA\nL\nN\nR REP\nE\nR\nP\nO\nR\nD\nO\nU\nD\nC\nU\nT\nC\nIO\nT\nN\nIO\nI\nN\nN FLOWERING PLANTS\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 1.15 (a) Structure of some seeds. (b) False fruits of apple and strawberry\nin which fruits develop without fertilisation. Such fruits are called\nparthenocarpic fruits. Banana is one such example. Parthenocarpy can 21\nbe induced through the application of growth hormones and such fruits\nare seedless. Seeds offer several advantages to angiosperms. Firstly, since\nreproductive processes such as pollination and fertilisation are\nindependent of water, seed formation is more dependable. Also seeds have\nbetter adaptive strategies for dispersal to new habitats and help the species\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nto colonise in other areas. As they have sufficient food reserves, young\nseedlings are nourished until they are capable of photosynthesis on their\nown. The hard seed coat provides protection to the young embryo. Being\nproducts of sexual reproduction, they generate new genetic combinations\nleading to variations. Seed is the basis of our agriculture. Dehydration and dormancy of\nmature seeds are crucial for storage of seeds which can be used as food\nthroughout the year and also to raise crop in the next season. Can you\nimagine agriculture in the absence of seeds, or in the presence of seeds\nwhich germinate straight away soon after formation and cannot be stored? How long do the seeds remain alive after they are dispersed? This\nperiod again varies greatly. In a few species the seeds lose viability within\na few months. Seeds of a large number of species live for several years. Some seeds can remain alive for hundreds of years. There are several\nrecords of very old yet viable seeds. The oldest is that of a lupine, Lupinus\narcticus excavated from Arctic Tundra. The seed germinated and flowered\nafter an estimated record of 10,000 years of dormancy.", "A recent record of\n2000 years old viable seed is of the date palm, Phoenix dactylifera\ndiscovered during the archeological excavation at King Herod’s palace\nnear the Dead Sea. After completing a brief account of sexual reproduction of flowering\nplants it would be worth attempting to comprehend the enormous\nreproductive capacity of some flowering plants by asking the following\nquestions: How many eggs are present in an embryo sac? How many\nembryo sacs are present in an ovule? How many ovules are present in\nan ovary? How many ovaries are present in a typical flower? How many\nflowers are present on a tree? And so on... Can you think of some plants in which fruits contain very large\nnumber of seeds. Orchid fruits are one such category and each fruit\ncontain thousands of tiny seeds. Similar is the case in fruits of some\nparasitic species such as Orobanche and Striga. Have you seen a tiny\nseed of Ficus? How large is the tree of Ficus developed from that tiny\nseed. How many billions of seeds does each Ficus tree produce? Can\nyou imagine any other example in which such a tiny structure can\nproduce such a large biomass over the years? 1.5 A P\nPOMIXIS AND OLYEMBRYONY\nAlthough seeds, in general are the products of fertilisation, a few flowering\n22 plants such as some species of Asteraceae and grasses, have evolved a\nspecial mechanism, to produce seeds without fertilisation, called apomixis. What is fruit production without fertilisation called? Thus, apomixis is a\nform of asexual reproduction that mimics sexual reproduction. There are\nseveral ways of development of apomictic seeds. In some species, the\ndiploid egg cell is formed without reduction division and develops into\nthe embryo without fertilisation. More often, as in many Citrus and Mango\nReprint 2025-26\nHSEX\nU\nU\nM\nA\nA\nL\nN\nR REP\nE\nR\nP\nO\nR\nD\nO\nU\nD\nC\nU\nT\nC\nIO\nT\nN\nIO\nI\nN\nN FLOWERING PLANTS\nvarieties some of the nucellar cells surrounding the embryo sac start\ndividing, protrude into the embryo sac and develop into the embryos. In\nsuch species each ovule contains many embryos. Occurrence of more\nthan one embryo in a seed is referred to as polyembryony. Take out\nsome seeds of orange and squeeze them. Observe the many embryos of\ndifferent sizes and shapes from each seed. Count the number of embryos\nin each seed. What would be the genetic nature of apomictic embryos? Can they be called clones? Hybrid varieties of several of our food and vegetable crops are being\nextensively cultivated. Cultivation of hybrids has tremendously increased\nproductivity. One of the problems of hybrids is that hybrid seeds have\nto be produced every year. If the seeds collected from hybrids are sown,\nthe plants in the progeny will segregate and do not maintain hybrid\ncharacters. Production of hybrid seeds is costly and hence the cost of\nhybrid seeds become too expensive for the farmers. If these hybrids are\nmade into apomicts, there is no segregation of characters in the hybrid\nprogeny.", "Then the farmers can keep on using the hybrid seeds to raise\nnew crop year after year and he does not have to buy hybrid seeds every\nyear. Because of the importance of apomixis in hybrid seed industry,\nactive research is going on in many laboratories around the world to\nunderstand the genetics of apomixis and to transfer apomictic genes\ninto hybrid varieties. SUMMARY\nFlowers are the seat of sexual reproduction in angiosperms. In the flower,\nandroecium consisting of stamens represents the male reproductive\norgans and gynoecium consisting of pistils represents the female\nreproductive organs. A typical anther is bilobed, dithecous and tetrasporangiate. Pollen\ngrains develop inside the microsporangia. Four wall layers, the\nepidermis, endothecium, middle layers and the tapetum surround the\nmicrosporangium. Cells of the sporogenous tissue lying in the centre of\nthe microsporangium, undergo meiosis (microsporogenesis) to form\ntetrads of microspores. Individual microspores mature into pollen grains. Pollen grains represents the male gametophytic generation. The\npollen grains have a two-layered wall, the outer exine and inner intine. The exine is made up of sporopollenin and has germ pores. Pollen grains\nmay have two cells (a vegetative cell and generative cell) or three cells (a\nvegetative cell and two male gametes) at the time of shedding. 23\nThe pistil has three parts – the stigma, style and the ovary. Ovules\nare present in the ovary. The ovules have a stalk called funicle, protective\nintegument(s), and an opening called micropyle. The central tissue is\nthe nucellus in which the archesporium differentiates. A cell of the\narchesporium, the megaspore mother cell divides meiotically and one of\nthe megaspores forms the embryo sac (the female gametophyte). The\nmature embryo sac is 7-celled and 8-nucleate. At the micropylar end is\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nthe egg apparatus consisting of two synergids and an egg cell. At the\nchalazal end are three antipodals. At the centre is a large central cell\nwith two polar nuclei. Pollination is the mechanism to transfer pollen grains from the\nanther to the stigma. Pollinating agents are either abiotic (wind and\nwater) or biotic (animals). Pollen-pistil interaction involves all events from the landing of pollen\ngrains on the stigma until the pollen tube enters the embryo sac (when\nthe pollen is compatible) or pollen inhibition (when the pollen is\nincompatible). Following compatible pollination, pollen grain germinates\non the stigma and the resulting pollen tube grow through the style,\nenter the ovules and finally discharges two male gametes in one of the\nsynergids. Angiosperms exhibit double fertilisation because two fusion\nevents occur in each embryo sac, namely syngamy and triple fusion. The products of these fusions are the diploid zygote and the triploid\nprimary endosperm nucleus (in the primary endosperm cell). Zygote\ndevelops into the embryo and the primary endosperm cell forms the\nendosperm tissue.", "Formation of endosperm always precedes\ndevelopment of the embryo. The developing embryo passes through different stages such as\nthe proembryo, globular and heart-shaped stages before maturation. Mature dicotyledonous embryo has two cotyledons and an embryonal\naxis with epicotyl and hypocotyl. Embryos of monocotyledons have a\nsingle cotyledon. After fertilisation, ovary develops into fruit and ovules\ndevelop into seeds. A phenomenon called apomixis is found in some angiosperms,\nparticularly in grasses. It results in the formation of seeds without\nfertilisation. Apomicts have several advantages in horticulture and\nagriculture. Some angiosperms produce more than one embryo in their seed. This phenomenon is called polyembryony. EXERCISES\n1. Name the parts of an angiosperm flower in which development of male\nand female gametophyte take place. 2.
