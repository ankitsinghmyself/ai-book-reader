["Chapter Fourteen\nSEMICONDUCTOR\nELECTRONICS:\nMATERIALS, DEVICES\nAND SIMPLE CIRCUITS\n14.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nDevices in which a controlled flow of electrons can be obtained are the\nbasic building blocks of all the electronic circuits. Before the discovery of\ntransistor in 1948, such devices were mostly vacuum tubes (also called\nvalves) like the vacuum diode which has two electrodes, viz., anode (often\ncalled plate) and cathode; triode which has three electrodes – cathode,\nplate and grid; tetrode and pentode (respectively with 4 and 5 electrodes). In a vacuum tube, the electrons are supplied by a heated cathode and\nthe controlled flow of these electrons in vacuum is obtained by varying\nthe voltage between its different electrodes. Vacuum is required in the\ninter-electrode space; otherwise the moving electrons may lose their\nenergy on collision with the air molecules in their path. In these devices\nthe electrons can flow only from the cathode to the anode (i.e., only in one\ndirection). Therefore, such devices are generally referred to as valves. These vacuum tube devices are bulky, consume high power, operate\ngenerally at high voltages (~100 V) and have limited life and low reliability. The seed of the development of modern solid-state semiconductor\nelectronics goes back to 1930’s when it was realised that some solid-\nstate semiconductors and their junctions offer the possibility of controlling\nthe number and the direction of flow of charge carriers through them. Simple excitations like light, heat or small applied voltage can change\nthe number of mobile charges in a semiconductor. Note that the supply\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nand flow of charge carriers in the semiconductor devices are within the\nsolid itself, while in the earlier vacuum tubes/valves, the mobile electrons\nwere obtained from a heated cathode and they were made to flow in an\nevacuated space or vacuum. No external heating or large evacuated space\nis required by the semiconductor devices. They are small in size, consume\nlow power, operate at low voltages and have long life and high reliability. Even the Cathode Ray Tubes (CRT) used in television and computer\nmonitors which work on the principle of vacuum tubes are being replaced\nby Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors with supporting solid state\nelectronics. Much before the full implications of the semiconductor devices\nwas formally understood, a naturally occurring crystal of galena (Lead\nsulphide, PbS) with a metal point contact attached to it was used as\ndetector of radio waves. In the following sections, we will introduce the basic concepts of\nsemiconductor physics and discuss some semiconductor devices like\njunction diodes (a 2-electrode device) and bipolar junction transistor (a\n3-electrode device). A few circuits illustrating their applications will also\nbe described.", "14.2 C M , C\nLASSIFICATION OF ETALS ONDUCTORS AND\nS\nEMICONDUCTORS\nOn the basis of conductivity\nOn the basis of the relative values of electrical conductivity (s) or resistivity\n(r = 1/s), the solids are broadly classified as:\n(i) Metals: They possess very low resistivity (or high conductivity). r ~ 10–2 – 10–8 W m\ns ~ 102 – 108 S m–1\n(ii) Semiconductors: They have resistivity or conductivity intermediate\nto metals and insulators. r ~ 10–5 – 106 W m\ns ~ 105 – 10–6 S m–1\n(iii)Insulators: They have high resistivity (or low conductivity). r ~ 1011 – 1019 W m\ns ~ 10–11 – 10–19 S m–1\nThe values of r and s given above are indicative of magnitude and\ncould well go outside the ranges as well. Relative values of the resistivity\nare not the only criteria for distinguishing metals, insulators and\nsemiconductors from each other. There are some other differences, which\nwill become clear as we go along in this chapter. Our interest in this chapter is in the study of semiconductors which\ncould be:\n(i) Elemental semiconductors: Si and Ge\n(ii) Compound semiconductors: Examples are:\n• Inorganic: CdS, GaAs, CdSe, InP, etc. • Organic: anthracene, doped pthalocyanines, etc. • Organic polymers: polypyrrole, polyaniline, polythiophene, etc. Most of the currently available semiconductor devices are based on\n324\nelemental semiconductors Si or Ge and compound inorganic\nsemiconductors. However, after 1990, a few semiconductor devices using\nReprint 2025-26\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\norganic semiconductors and semiconducting polymers have been\ndeveloped signalling the birth of a futuristic technology of polymer-\nelectronics and molecular-electronics. In this chapter, we will restrict\nourselves to the study of inorganic semiconductors, particularly\nelemental semiconductors Si and Ge. The general concepts introduced\nhere for discussing the elemental semiconductors, by-and-large, apply\nto most of the compound semiconductors as well. On the basis of energy bands\nAccording to the Bohr atomic model, in an isolated atom the energy of\nany of its electrons is decided by the orbit in which it revolves. But when\nthe atoms come together to form a solid they are close to each other. So\nthe outer orbits of electrons from neighbouring atoms would come very\nclose or could even overlap. This would make the nature of electron motion\nin a solid very different from that in an isolated atom. Inside the crystal each electron has a unique position and no two\nelectrons see exactly the same pattern of surrounding charges. Because\nof this, each electron will have a different energy level. These different\nenergy levels with continuous energy variation form what are called\nenergy bands. The energy band which includes the energy levels of the\nvalence electrons is called the valence band. The energy band above the\nvalence band is called the conduction band. With no external energy, all\nthe valence electrons will reside in the valence band.", "If the lowest level in\nthe conduction band happens to be lower than the highest level of the\nvalence band, the electrons from the valence band can easily move into\nthe conduction band. Normally the conduction band is empty. But when\nit overlaps on the valence band electrons can move freely into it. This is\nthe case with metallic conductors. If there is some gap between the conduction band and the valence\nband, electrons in the valence band all remain bound and no free electrons\nare available in the conduction band. This makes the material an\ninsulator. But some of the electrons from the valence band may gain\nexternal energy to cross the gap between the conduction band and the\nvalence band. Then these electrons will move into the conduction band. At the same time they will create vacant energy levels in the valence band\nwhere other valence electrons can move. Thus the process creates the\npossibility of conduction due to electrons in conduction band as well as\ndue to vacancies in the valence band. Let us consider what happens in the case of Si or Ge crystal containing\nN atoms. For Si, the outermost orbit is the third orbit (n = 3), while for Ge\nit is the fourth orbit (n = 4). The number of electrons in the outermost\norbit is 4 (2s and 2p electrons). Hence, the total number of outer electrons\nin the crystal is 4N. The maximum possible number of electrons in the\nouter orbit is 8 (2s + 6p electrons). So, for the 4N valence electrons there\nare 8N available energy states. These 8N discrete energy levels can either\nform a continuous band or they may be grouped in different bands\ndepending upon the distance between the atoms in the crystal (see box\non Band Theory of Solids). At the distance between the atoms in the crystal lattices of Si and Ge,\nthe energy band of these 8N states is split apart into two which are\nseparated by an energy gap E (Fig. 14.1). The lower band which is\ng\ncompletely occupied by the 4N valence electrons at temperature of absolute 325\nzero is the valence band. The other band consisting of 4N energy states,\ncalled the conduction band, is completely empty at absolute zero. Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nThe lowest energy level in the\nconduction band is shown as E and\nC\nhighest energy level in the valence band\nis shown as E . Above E and below E\nV C V\nthere are a large number of closely spaced\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig. 14.1. The gap between the top of the valence\nband and bottom of the conduction band\nis called the energy band gap (Energy gap\nE ). It may be large, small, or zero,\ng\ndepending upon the material. These\ndifferent situations, are depicted in Fig. 14.2 and discussed below:\nCase I: This refers to a situation, as\nshown in Fig. 14.2(a).

This situation makes a large number of\nelectrons available for electrical conduction. When the valence band is\npartially empty, electrons from its lower level can move to higher level\nmaking conduction possible. Therefore, the resistance of such materials\nis low or the conductivity is high. FIGURE 14.2 Difference between energy bands of (a) metals,\n326\n(b) insulators and (c) semiconductors. Reprint 2025-26\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nCase II: In this case, as shown in Fig. 14.2(b), a large band gap E exists\ng\n(E > 3 eV). There are no electrons in the conduction band, and therefore\ng\nno electrical conduction is possible. Note that the energy gap is so large\nthat electrons cannot be excited from the valence band to the conduction\nband by thermal excitation. This is the case of insulators. Case III: This situation is shown in Fig. 14.2(c). Here a finite but small\nband gap (E < 3 eV) exists. Because of the small band gap, at room\ng\ntemperature some electrons from valence band can acquire enough\nenergy to cross the energy gap and enter the conduction band. These\nelectrons (though small in numbers) can move in the conduction band. Hence, the resistance of semiconductors is not as high as that of the\ninsulators. In this section we have made a broad classification of metals,\nconductors and semiconductors. In the section which follows you will\nlearn the conduction process in semiconductors. 14.3 I S\nNTRINSIC EMICONDUCTOR\nWe shall take the most common case of Ge and Si whose\nlattice structure is shown in Fig. 14.3. These structures\nare called the diamond-like structures. Each atom is\nsurrounded by four nearest neighbours. We know that\nSi and Ge have four valence electrons. In its crystalline\nstructure, every Si or Ge atom tends to share one of its\nfour valence electrons with each of its four nearest\nneighbour atoms, and also to take share of one electron\nfrom each such neighbour. These shared electron pairs\nare referred to as forming a covalent bond or simply a\nvalence bond. The two shared electrons can be assumed\nto shuttle back-and-forth between the associated atoms\nholding them together strongly.

It shows an idealised picture in which no Silicon or Germanium with\nbonds are broken (all bonds are intact). Such a situation respective lattice spacing a equal\narises at low temperatures.", "As the temperature increases, to 3.56, 5.43 and 5.66 Å. more thermal energy becomes available to these electrons and some of\nthese electrons may break–away (becoming free electrons contributing to\nconduction). The thermal energy effectively ionises only a few atoms in the\ncrystalline lattice and creates a vacancy in the bond as shown in Fig. 14.5(a). The neighbourhood, from which the free electron (with charge –q) has come\nout leaves a vacancy with an effective charge (+q). This vacancy with the\neffective positive electronic charge is called a hole. The hole behaves as an\napparent free particle with effective positive charge. In intrinsic semiconductors, the number of free electrons, n is equal to\ne\nthe number of holes, n . That is\nh\nn = n = n (14.1)\ne h i\nwhere n is called intrinsic carrier concentration. i\nSemiconductors posses the unique property in which, apart from\nelectrons, the holes also move. Suppose there is a hole at site 1 as shown 327\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nin Fig. 14.5(a). The movement of holes can be\nvisualised as shown in Fig. 14.5(b). An electron\nfrom the covalent bond at site 2 may jump to\nthe vacant site 1 (hole). Thus, after such a jump,\nthe hole is at site 2 and the site 1 has now an\nelectron. Therefore, apparently, the hole has\nmoved from site 1 to site 2. Note that the electron\noriginally set free [Fig. 14.5(a)] is not involved\nin this process of hole motion. The free electron\nmoves completely independently as conduction\nelectron and gives rise to an electron current, I\ne\nunder an applied electric field.

Example 14.1 C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C\ninsulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors? Solution The 4 bonding electrons of C, Si or Ge lie, respectively, in\nthe second, third and fourth orbit. Hence, energy required to take\nout an electron from these atoms (i.e., ionisation energy E ) will be\ng\nleast for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free\nelectrons for conduction in Ge and Si are significant but negligibly\nsmall for C. 14.4 E S\nXTRINSIC EMICONDUCTOR\nThe conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor depends on its\ntemperature, but at room temperature its conductivity is very low. As\nsuch, no important electronic devices can be developed using these\nsemiconductors. Hence there is a necessity of improving their\nconductivity. This can be done by making use of impurities. When a small amount, say, a few parts per million (ppm), of a suitable\nimpurity is added to the pure semiconductor, the conductivity of the\nsemiconductor is increased manifold. Such materials are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors or impurity semiconductors. The deliberate\naddition of a desirable impurity is called doping and the impurity atoms\nare called dopants. Such a material is also called a doped semiconductor. The dopant has to be such that it does not distort the original pure\nsemiconductor lattice. It occupies only a very few of the original\nsemiconductor atom sites in the crystal. A necessary condition to attain\nthis is that the sizes of the dopant and the semiconductor atoms should\nbe nearly the same. There are two types of dopants used in doping the tetravalent Si\nor Ge:\n(i) Pentavalent (valency 5); like Arsenic (As), Antimony (Sb), Phosphorous\n(P), etc. Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n(ii) Trivalent (valency 3); like Indium (In),\nBoron (B), Aluminium (Al), etc. We shall now discuss how the doping\nchanges the number of charge carriers (and\nhence the conductivity) of semiconductors.", "Si or Ge belongs to the fourth group in the\nPeriodic table and, therefore, we choose the\ndopant element from nearby fifth or third\ngroup, expecting and taking care that the\nsize of the dopant atom is nearly the same as\nthat of Si or Ge. Interestingly, the pentavalent\nand trivalent dopants in Si or Ge give two\nentirely different types of semiconductors as\ndiscussed below. (i) n-type semiconductor\nSuppose we dope Si or Ge with a pentavalent\nelement as shown in Fig. 14.7. When an atom\nof +5 valency element occupies the position\nof an atom in the crystal lattice of Si, four of\nits electrons bond with the four silicon\nneighbours while the fifth remains very\nweakly bound to its parent atom. This is\nbecause the four electrons participating in\nFIGURE 14.7 (a) Pentavalent donor atom (As, Sb, bonding are seen as part of the effective core\nP, etc.) doped for tetravalent Si or Ge giving n- of the atom by the fifth electron.

For example, the\npositive charge and its associated extra electron. energy required is ~ 0.01 eV for germanium,\nand 0.05 eV for silicon, to separate this\nelectron from its atom. This is in contrast to the energy required to jump\nthe forbidden band (about 0.72 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for\nsilicon) at room temperature in the intrinsic semiconductor. Thus, the\npentavalent dopant is donating one extra electron for conduction and\nhence is known as donor impurity. The number of electrons made\navailable for conduction by dopant atoms depends strongly upon the\ndoping level and is independent of any increase in ambient temperature. On the other hand, the number of free electrons (with an equal number\nof holes) generated by Si atoms, increases weakly with temperature. In a doped semiconductor the total number of conduction electrons\nn is due to the electrons contributed by donors and those generated\ne\nintrinsically, while the total number of holes n is only due to the holes\nh\nfrom the intrinsic source. But the rate of recombination of holes would\nincrease due to the increase in the number of electrons. As a result, the\nnumber of holes would get reduced further. Thus, with proper level of doping the number of conduction electrons\n330\ncan be made much larger than the number of holes. Hence in an extrinsic\nReprint 2025-26\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nsemiconductor doped with pentavalent impurity, electrons\nbecome the majority carriers and holes the minority carriers. These semiconductors are, therefore, known as n-type\nsemiconductors.", "For n-type semiconductors, we have,\nn >> n (14.3)\ne h\n(ii) p-type semiconductor\nThis is obtained when Si or Ge is doped with a trivalent impurity\nlike Al, B, In, etc. The dopant has one valence electron less than\nSi or Ge and, therefore, this atom can form covalent bonds with\nneighbouring three Si atoms but does not have any electron to\noffer to the fourth Si atom. So the bond between the fourth\nneighbour and the trivalent atom has a vacancy or hole as\nshown in Fig. 14.8. Since the neighbouring Si atom in the lattice\nwants an electron in place of a hole, an electron in the outer\norbit of an atom in the neighbourhood may jump to fill this\nvacancy, leaving a vacancy or hole at its own site. Thus the hole\nis available for conduction. Note that the trivalent foreign atom\nbecomes effectively negatively charged when it shares fourth\nelectron with neighbouring Si atom. Therefore, the dopant atom\nof p-type material can be treated as core of one negative charge\nalong with its associated hole as shown in Fig. 14.8(b). It is\nobvious that one acceptor atom gives one hole. These holes are\nin addition to the intrinsically generated holes while the source\nof conduction electrons is only intrinsic generation. Thus, for\nsuch a material, the holes are the majority carriers and electrons\nare minority carriers. Therefore, extrinsic semiconductors doped FIGURE 14.8 (a) Trivalent\nacceptor atom (In, Al, B etc.)\nwith trivalent impurity are called p-type semiconductors.

Hence, the dopant, by adding a large number of\ncurrent carriers of one type, which become the majority carriers, indirectly\nhelps to reduce the intrinsic concentration of minority carriers. The semiconductor’s energy band structure is affected by doping. In\nthe case of extrinsic semiconductors, additional energy states due to donor\nimpurities (E ) and acceptor impurities (E ) also exist. In the energy band\nD A\ndiagram of n-type Si semiconductor, the donor energy level E is slightly\nD\nbelow the bottom E of the conduction band and electrons from this level\nC\nmove into the conduction band with very small supply of energy.", "At room\ntemperature, most of the donor atoms get ionised but very few (~1012)\natoms of Si get ionised. So the conduction band will have most electrons\n331\ncoming from the donor impurities, as shown in Fig. 14.9(a). Similarly,\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n332\n2.41\nELPMAXE\nfor p-type semiconductor, the acceptor energy level E is slightly above\nA\nthe top E of the valence band as shown in Fig. 14.9(b).

(Alternately, we can also say that\nA\nwith very small supply of energy the hole from level E sinks down into\nA\nthe valence band. Electrons rise up and holes fall down when they gain\nexternal energy.) At room temperature, most of the acceptor atoms get\nionised leaving holes in the valence band. Thus at room temperature the\ndensity of holes in the valence band is predominantly due to impurity in\nthe extrinsic semiconductor. The electron and hole concentration in a\nsemiconductor in thermal equilibrium is given by\nn n = n2 (14.5)\ne h i\nThough the above description is grossly approximate and\nhypothetical, it helps in understanding the difference between metals,\ninsulators and semiconductors (extrinsic and intrinsic) in a simple\nmanner. The difference in the resistivity of C, Si and Ge depends upon\nthe energy gap between their conduction and valence bands. For C\n(diamond), Si and Ge, the energy gaps are 5.4 eV, 1.1 eV and 0.7 eV,\nrespectively. Sn also is a group IV element but it is a metal because the\nenergy gap in its case is 0 eV.

We will now try to understand how a junction is formed and how the\njunction behaves under the influence of external applied voltage (also\ncalled bias). 14.5.1 p-n junction formation\nConsider a thin p-type silicon (p-Si) semiconductor wafer. By adding\nprecisely a small quantity of pentavelent impurity, part of the p-Si wafer\ncan be converted into n-Si. There are several processes by which a\nsemiconductor can be formed. The wafer now contains p-region and\nn-region and a metallurgical junction between p-, and n- region.", "Two important processes occur during the formation of a p-n junction:\ndiffusion and drift. We know that in an n-type semiconductor, the\nconcentration of electrons (number of electrons per unit volume) is more\ncompared to the concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type\nsemiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than the concentration\nof electrons. During the formation of p-n junction, and due to the\nconcentration gradient across p-, and n- sides, holes diffuse from p-side\nto n-side (p fi n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n fi p). This\nmotion of charge carries gives rise to diffusion current across the junction. When an electron diffuses from n fi p, it leaves behind an ionised\ndonor on n-side. This ionised donor (positive charge) is immobile as it is\nbonded to the surrounding atoms. As the electrons continue to diffuse\nfrom n fi p, a layer of positive charge (or positive space-charge region) on\nn-side of the junction is developed. Similarly, when a hole diffuses from p fi n due to the concentration\ngradient, it leaves behind an ionised acceptor (negative charge) which is\nimmobile. As the holes continue to diffuse, a layer of negative charge (or\nnegative space-charge region) on the p-side of the junction is developed. This space-charge region on either side of the junction together is known\nas depletion region as the electrons and holes taking\npart in the initial movement across the junction depleted\nthe region of its free charges (Fig. 14.10). The thickness\nof depletion region is of the order of one-tenth of a\nmicrometre. Due to the positive space-charge region on\nn-side of the junction and negative space charge region\non p-side of the junction, an electric field directed from\npositive charge towards negative charge develops. Due\nto this field, an electron on p-side of the junction moves\nto n-side and a hole on n-side of the junction moves to p- FIGURE 14.10 p-n junction\nside. The motion of charge carriers due to the electric field formation process. is called drift. Thus a drift current, which is opposite in\ndirection to the diffusion current (Fig. 14.10) starts. 333\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/solids/pnjun.html Formation\nand\nworking\nof\np-n\njunction\ndiode\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n334\n3.41\nELPMAXE\nInitially, diffusion current is large and drift current is small. As the diffusion process continues, the space-charge regions\non either side of the junction extend, thus increasing the electric\nfield strength and hence drift current. This process continues\nuntil the diffusion current equals the drift current. Thus a p-n\njunction is formed. In a p-n junction under equilibrium there\nis no net current. The loss of electrons from the n-region and the gain of\nelectron by the p-region causes a difference of potential across\nthe junction of the two regions. The polarity of this potential is\nsuch as to oppose further flow of carriers so that a condition of\nequilibrium exists.", "Figure 14.11 shows the p-n junction at\nequilibrium and the potential across the junction.

Example 14.3 Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and\nphysically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction? Solution No! Any slab, howsoever flat, will have roughness much\nlarger than the inter-atomic crystal spacing (~2 to 3 Å) and hence\ncontinuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. The junction\nwill behave as a discontinuity for the flowing charge carriers. 14.6 S D\nEMICONDUCTOR IODE\nA semiconductor diode [Fig. 14.12(a)] is basically a p-n\njunction with metallic contacts provided at the ends for\nthe application of an external voltage. It is a two terminal\ndevice. A p-n junction diode is symbolically represented\nas shown in Fig. 14.12(b). The direction of arrow indicates the conventional\ndirection of current (when the diode is under forward\np n bias). The equilibrium barrier potential can be altered\nby applying an external voltage V across the diode. The\nFIGURE 14.12 (a) Semiconductor diode, situation of p-n junction diode under equilibrium\n(b) Symbol for p-n junction diode. (without bias) is shown in Fig. 14.11(a) and (b). 14.6.1 p-n junction diode under forward bias\nWhen an external voltage V is applied across a semiconductor diode such\nthat p-side is connected to the positive terminal of the battery and n-side\nto the negative terminal [Fig. 14.13(a)], it is said to be forward biased. The applied voltage mostly drops across the depletion region and the\nvoltage drop across the p-side and n-side of the junction is negligible. (This is because the resistance of the depletion region – a region where\nthere are no charges – is very high compared to the resistance of n-side\nand p-side.) The direction of the applied voltage (V) is opposite to the\nReprint 2025-26\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nbuilt-in potential V . As a result, the depletion layer width\n0\ndecreases and the barrier height is reduced [Fig. 14.13(b)]. The\neffective barrier height under forward bias is (V – V). 0\nIf the applied voltage is small, the barrier potential will be\nreduced only slightly below the equilibrium value, and only a\nsmall number of carriers in the material—those that happen to\nbe in the uppermost energy levels—will possess enough energy\nto cross the junction. So the current will be small. If we increase\nthe applied voltage significantly, the barrier height will be reduced\nand more number of carriers will have the required energy. Thus\nthe current increases.", "Due to the applied voltage, electrons from n-side cross the\ndepletion region and reach p-side (where they are minority\ncarries). Similarly, holes from p-side cross the junction and reach\nthe n-side (where they are minority carries). This process under\nforward bias is known as minority carrier injection.

The applied voltage mostly\ndrops across the depletion region. The direction of applied voltage is same\nas the direction of barrier potential. As a result, the barrier height increases\nand the depletion region widens due to the change in the electric field. The effective barrier height under reverse bias is (V + V), [Fig. 14.15(b)]. 0\nThis suppresses the flow of electrons from n fi p and holes from p fi n. Thus, diffusion current, decreases enormously compared to the diode\nunder forward bias. The electric field direction of the junction is such that if electrons on\np-side or holes on n-side in their random motion come close to the\njunction, they will be swept to its majority zone. This drift of carriers\ngives rise to current. The drift current is of the order of a few mA. This is\nquite low because it is due to the motion of carriers from their minority\nside to their majority side across the junction. The drift current is also\nthere under forward bias but it is negligible (mA) when compared with\ncurrent due to injected carriers which is usually in mA. The diode reverse current is not very much dependent on the applied\nvoltage. Even a small voltage is sufficient to sweep the minority carriers\n335\nfrom one side of the junction to the other side of the junction. The current\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nis not limited by the magnitude of the applied voltage but is\nlimited due to the concentration of the minority carrier on either\nside of the junction. The current under reverse bias is essentially voltage\nindependent upto a critical reverse bias voltage, known as\nbreakdown voltage (V ).", "When V = V , the diode reverse current\nbr br\nincreases sharply. Even a slight increase in the bias voltage causes\nlarge change in the current. If the reverse current is not limited by\nan external circuit below the rated value (specified by the\nmanufacturer) the p-n junction will get destroyed.

After the characteristic\nvoltage, the diode current increases significantly (exponentially), even for\na very small increase in the diode bias voltage. This voltage is called the\nthreshold voltage or cut-in voltage (~0.2V for germanium diode and\n~0.7 V for silicon diode). For the diode in reverse bias, the current is very small (~mA) and almost\nremains constant with change in bias. It is called reverse saturation\ncurrent. However, for special cases, at very high reverse bias (break down\nvoltage), the current suddenly increases. This special action of the diode\nis discussed later in Section 14.8. The general purpose diode are not\nused beyond the reverse saturation current region. The above discussion shows that the p-n junction diode primerly\nallows the flow of current only in one direction (forward bias). The forward\nbias resistance is low as compared to the reverse bias resistance. This\nproperty is used for rectification of ac voltages as discussed in the next\nsection.

So if an alternating voltage is\napplied across a diode the current flows only in that part of the cycle\nwhen the diode is forward biased. This property\nis used to rectify alternating voltages and the\ncircuit used for this purpose is called a rectifier. If an alternating voltage is applied across a\ndiode in series with a load, a pulsating voltage will\nappear across the load only during the half cycles\nof the ac input during which the diode is forward\nbiased. Such rectifier circuit, as shown in\nFig. 14.18, is called a half-wave rectifier. The\nsecondary of a transformer supplies the desired\nac voltage across terminals A and B. When the\nvoltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased\nand it conducts. When A is negative, the diode is\nreverse-biased and it does not conduct. The reverse\nsaturation current of a diode is negligible and can\nbe considered equal to zero for practical purposes. (The reverse breakdown voltage of the diode must\nbe sufficiently higher than the peak ac voltage at\nthe secondary of the transformer to protect the\ndiode from reverse breakdown.)\nTherefore, in the positive half-cycle of ac there\nFIGURE 14.18 (a) Half-wave rectifier\nis a current through the load resistor R and we\ncircuit, (b) Input ac voltage and output L\nget an output voltage, as shown in Fig. 14.18(b),\nvoltage waveforms from the rectifier circuit. whereas there is no current in the negative half-\ncycle. In the next positive half-cycle, again we get\nthe output voltage. Thus, the output voltage, though still varying, is\nrestricted to only one direction and is said to be rectified. Since the\nrectified output of this circuit is only for half of the input ac wave it is\ncalled as half-wave rectifier. The circuit using two diodes, shown in Fig. 14.19(a), gives output\nrectified voltage corresponding to both the positive as well as negative\nhalf of the ac cycle. Hence, it is known as full-wave rectifier. Here the\np-side of the two diodes are connected to the ends of the secondary of the\ntransformer. The n-side of the diodes are connected together and the\noutput is taken between this common point of diodes and the midpoint\nof the secondary of the transformer. So for a full-wave rectifier the\nsecondary of the transformer is provided with a centre tapping and so it\nis called centre-tap transformer. As can be seen from Fig.14.19(c) the\nvoltage rectified by each diode is only half the total secondary voltage.", "Each diode rectifies only for half the cycle, but the two do so for alternate\ncycles. Thus, the output between their common terminals and the centre-\ntap of the transformer becomes a full-wave rectifier output. (Note that\nthere is another circuit of full wave rectifier which does not need a centre-\n338 tap transformer but needs four diodes.) Suppose the input voltage to A\nReprint 2025-26\nSemiconductor Electronics:\nMaterials, Devices and\nSimple Circuits\nwith respect to the centre tap at any instant\nis positive. It is clear that, at that instant,\nvoltage at B being out of phase will be\nnegative as shown in Fig.14.19(b). So, diode\nD gets forward biased and conducts (while\n1\nD being reverse biased is not conducting). 2\nHence, during this positive half cycle we get\nan output current (and a output voltage\nacross the load resistor R ) as shown in\nL\nFig.14.19(c). In the course of the ac cycle\nwhen the voltage at A becomes negative with\nrespect to centre tap, the voltage at B would\nbe positive. In this part of the cycle diode\nD would not conduct but diode D would,\n1 2\ngiving an output current and output\nvoltage (across R ) during the negative half\nL\ncycle of the input ac. Thus, we get output\nvoltage during both the positive as well as\nthe negative half of the cycle. Obviously,\nthis is a more efficient circuit for getting\nrectified voltage or current than the half-\nwave rectifier. The rectified voltage is in the form of\npulses of the shape of half sinusoids. Though it is unidirectional it does not have\na steady value.

Metals have low resistivity (10–2 to 10–8 Wm), insulators have very high\nresistivity (>108 Wm–1), while semiconductors have intermediate values\nof resistivity. 4. Semiconductors are elemental (Si, Ge) as well as compound (GaAs,\nCdS, etc.). 5. Pure semiconductors are called ‘intrinsic semiconductors’. The presence\nof charge carriers (electrons and holes) is an ‘intrinsic’ property of the\nmaterial and these are obtained as a result of thermal excitation. The\nnumber of electrons (n ) is equal to the number of holes (n ) in intrinsic\ne h\nconductors. Holes are essentially electron vacancies with an effective\npositive charge. 6. The number of charge carriers can be changed by ‘doping’ of a suitable\nimpurity in pure semiconductors. Such semiconductors are known as\nextrinsic semiconductors. These are of two types (n-type and p-type). 7. In n-type semiconductors, n >> n while in p-type semiconductors n >> n. e h h e\n8. n-type semiconducting Si or Ge is obtained by doping with pentavalent\natoms (donors) like As, Sb, P, etc., while p-type Si or Ge can be obtained\nby doping with trivalent atom (acceptors) like B, Al, In etc. 9. n n = n2 in all cases. Further, the material possesses an overall charge\ne h i\nneutrality. 10. There are two distinct band of energies (called valence band and\nconduction band) in which the electrons in a material lie. Valence\nband energies are low as compared to conduction band energies. All\nenergy levels in the valence band are filled while energy levels in the\nconduction band may be fully empty or partially filled. The electrons in\nthe conduction band are free to move in a solid and are responsible for\nthe conductivity. The extent of conductivity depends upon the energy\ngap (E ) between the top of valence band (E ) and the bottom of the\ng V\nconduction band E .

In elemental semiconductors (Si or Ge), the n-type or p-type\nsemiconductors are obtained by introducing ‘dopants’ as defects. In\ncompound semiconductors, the change in relative stoichiometric ratio\ncan also change the type of semiconductor.

The latter is the ratio of the angular size of the object\n(which is equal to the angular size of the image even if the image\nis magnified) to the angular size of the object if placed at the near\npoint (25 cm). Thus, magnification magnitude is |(v/u)| and\nmagnifying power is (25/ |u|). Only when the image is located at\nthe near point |v| = 25 cm, are the two quantities equal. 9.23 (a) Maximum magnifying power is obtained when the image is at\nthe near point (25 cm)\nu = – 7.14 cm.

The magnifier helps in the following way: without it\nobject would be placed no closer than 25 cm; with it the object\ncan be placed much closer. The closer object has larger angular\nsize than the same object at 25 cm. It is in this sense that angular\nmagnification is achieved. (b) Yes, it decreases a little because the angle subtended at the eye\nis then slightly less than the angle subtended at the lens.

[Note: When the eye is separated from the lens, the angles\nsubtended at the eye by the first object and its image are not\nequal.]\n(c) First, grinding lens of very small focal length is not easy. More\nimportant, if you decrease focal length, aberrations (both spherical\nand chromatic) become more pronounced. So, in practice, you\ncannot get a magnifying power of more than 3 or so with a simple\nconvex lens. However, using an aberration corrected lens system,\none can increase this limit by a factor of 10 or so.

All the rays from the object refracted by objective go through the\neye-ring. Therefore, it is an ideal position for our eyes for viewing. If we place our eyes too close to the eye-piece, we shall not collect\nmuch of the light and also reduce our field of view. If we position\nour eyes on the eye-ring and the area of the pupil of our eye is\ngreater or equal to the area of the eye-ring, our eyes will collect\nall the light refracted by the objective. The precise location of\nthe eye-ring naturally depends on the separation between the\nobjective and the eye-piece. When you view through a microscope\nby placing your eyes on one end,the ideal distance between the\neyes and eye-piece is usually built-in the design of the\ninstrument. 9.26 Assume microscope in normal use i.e., image at 25 cm.

Height of the\nfinal image (magnitude) = 28 cm. 9.29 The image formed by the larger (concave) mirror acts as virtual object\nfor the smaller (convex) mirror. Parallel rays coming from the object\nat infinity will focus at a distance of 110 mm from the larger mirror. The distance of virtual object for the smaller mirror = (110 –20) =\n90 mm. The focal length of smaller mirror is 70 mm. Using the mirror\nformula, image is formed at 315 mm from the smaller mirror. 9.30 The reflected rays get deflected by twice the angle of rotation of the\nmirror. Therefore, d/1.5 = tan 7°.
