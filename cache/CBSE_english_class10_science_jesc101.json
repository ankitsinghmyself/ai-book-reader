["“Facts are not science — as the dictionary is not literature.”\nMartin H. Fischer\n1\nCHAPTER\nChemical Reactions\nand Equations\nConsider the following situations of daily life and think what happens\nwhen –\nn milk is left at room temperature during summers. n an iron tawa/pan/nail is left exposed to humid atmosphere. n grapes get fermented. n food is cooked. n food gets digested in our body. n we respire. In all the above situations, the nature and the identity of the initial\nsubstance have somewhat changed. We have already learnt about physical\nand chemical changes of matter in our previous classes. Whenever a chemical\nchange occurs, we can say that a chemical reaction has taken place. You may perhaps be wondering as to what is actually meant by a\nchemical reaction. How do we come to know that a chemical reaction\nhas taken place? Let us perform some activities to find the answer to\nthese questions. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 11111.....11111\nCAUTION: This Activity needs\nthe teacher’s assistance.

This description of a\ndilute sulphuric acid on\nchemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long. It can be written in a\nzinc\nshorter form. The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a\nword-equation. The word-equation for the above reaction would be –\nMagnesium + Oxygen → Magnesium oxide (1.1)\n(Reactants) (Product)\nThe substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction (1.1),\nmagnesium and oxygen, are the reactants. The new substance is\nmagnesium oxide, formed during the reaction, as a product. A word-equation shows change of reactants to products through an\narrow placed between them. The reactants are written on the left-hand\nside (LHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. Similarly, products are\nwritten on the right-hand side (RHS) with a plus sign (+) between them. The arrowhead points towards the products, and shows the direction of\nthe reaction. 2 Science\nReprint 2025-26\n1.1.1 Writing a Chemical Equation\nIs there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations? Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use\nchemical formulae instead of words. A chemical equation represents a\nchemical reaction. If you recall formulae of magnesium, oxygen and\nmagnesium oxide, the above word-equation can be written as –\nMg + O → MgO (1.2)\n2\nCount and compare the number of atoms of each element on the\nLHS and RHS of the arrow. Is the number of atoms of each element the\nsame on both the sides? If yes, then the equation is balanced. If not,\nthen the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on\nboth sides of the equation. Such a chemical equation is a skeletal\nchemical equation for a reaction. Equation (1.2) is a skeletal chemical\nequation for the burning of magnesium in air. 1.1.2 Balanced Chemical Equations\nRecall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX; mass\ncan neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. That is, the\ntotal mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction\nhas to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants. In other words, the number of atoms of each element remains the\nsame, before and after a chemical reaction. Hence, we need to balance a\nskeletal chemical equation. Is the chemical Eq. (1.2) balanced? Let us\nlearn about balancing a chemical equation step by step. The word-equation for Activity 1.3 may be represented as –\nZinc + Sulphuric acid → Zinc sulphate + Hydrogen\nThe above word-equation may be represented by the following\nchemical equation –\nZn + H SO → ZnSO + H (1.3)\n2 4 4 2\nLet us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both\nsides of the arrow.", "Element Number of atoms in Number of atoms\nreactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nZn 1 1\nH 2 2\nS 1 1\nO 4 4\nAs the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of\nthe arrow, Eq. (1.3) is a balanced chemical equation. Let us try to balance the following chemical equation –\nFe + H O → Fe O + H (1.4)\n2 3 4 2\nChemical Reactions and Equations 3\nReprint 2025-26\nStep I: To balance a chemical equation, first draw boxes around each\nformula. Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the\nequation. Fe + H O → Fe O + H (1.5)\n2 3 4 2\nStep II: List the number of atoms of different elements present in the\nunbalanced equation (1.5). Element Number of atoms Number of atoms\nin reactants (LHS) in products (RHS)\nFe 1 3\nH 2 2\nO 1 4\nStep III: It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound\nthat contains the maximum number of atoms. It may be a reactant or a\nproduct. In that compound, select the element which has the maximum\nnumber of atoms. Using these criteria, we select Fe O and the element\n3 4\noxygen in it. There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on\nthe LHS. To balance the oxygen atoms –\nAtoms of In reactants In products\noxygen\n(i) Initial 1 (in H O) 4 (in Fe O )\n2 3 4\n(ii) To balance 1×4 4\nTo equalise the number of atoms, it must be remembered that we\ncannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the\nreactions. For example, to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient\n‘4’ as 4 H O and not H O or (H O) . Now the partly balanced equation\n2 2 4 2 4\nbecomes–\n(1.6)\nFe + 4 H O → Fe O + H\n2 3 4 2 (partly balanced equation)\nStep IV: Fe and H atoms are still not balanced. Pick any of these elements\nto proceed further. Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced\nequation. To equalise the number of H atoms, make the number of molecules\nof hydrogen as four on the RHS. Atoms of In reactants In products\nhydrogen\n(i) Initial 8 (in 4 H O) 2 (in H )\n2 2\n(ii) To balance 8 2 × 4\nThe equation would be –\n(1.7)\nFe + 4 H O → Fe O + 4 H\n2 3 4 2 (partly balanced equation)\n4 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nStep V: Examine the above equation and pick up the third element\nwhich is not balanced. You find that only one element is left to be\nbalanced, that is, iron. Atoms of In reactants In products\niron\n(i) Initial 1 (in Fe) 3 (in Fe O )\n3 4\n(ii) To balance 1×3 3\nTo equalise Fe, we take three atoms of Fe on the LHS. 3 Fe + 4 H O → Fe O + 4 H (1.8)\n2 3 4 2\nStep VI: Finally, to check the correctness of the balanced equation, we\ncount atoms of each element on both sides of the equation. (1.9)\n3Fe + 4H O → Fe O + 4H\n2 3 4 2 (balanced equation)\nThe numbers of atoms of elements on both sides of Eq. (1.9) are\nequal. This equation is now balanced. This method of balancing chemical\nequations is called hit-and-trial method as we make trials to balance\nthe equation by using the smallest whole number coefficient.", "Step VII: WWWWWrrrrriiiiitttttiiiiinnnnnggggg SSSSSyyyyymmmmmbbbbbooooolllllsssss ooooofffff PPPPPhhhhhyyyyysssssiiiiicccccaaaaalllll SSSSStttttaaaaattttteeeeesssss Carefully examine\nthe above balanced Eq. (1.9). Does this equation tell us anything about\nthe physical state of each reactant and product? No information has\nbeen given in this equation about their physical states. To make a chemical equation more informative, the physical states\nof the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical\nformulae. The gaseous, liquid, aqueous and solid states of reactants\nand products are represented by the notations (g), (l), (aq) and (s),\nrespectively. The word aqueous (aq) is written if the reactant or product\nis present as a solution in water. The balanced Eq. (1.9) becomes\n3Fe(s) + 4H O(g) → Fe O (s) + 4H (g) (1.10)\n2 3 4 2\nNote that the symbol (g) is used with H O to indicate that in this\n2\nreaction water is used in the form of steam. Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless\nit is necessary to specify them. Sometimes the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pressure,\ncatalyst, etc., for the reaction are indicated above and/or below the arrow\nin the equation. For example –\nCO(g) + 2H (g)340atm→CH OH(l) (1.11)\n2 3\n6CO (aq)+12H\nO(l)Sunlight→C\nH O (aq)+6O (aq)+6H O(l)(1.12)\n2 2 Chlorophyll 6 12 6 22 2\n(Glucose)\nUsing these steps, can you balance Eq.

Nor do atoms\ndisappear from the mixture or appear from elsewhere. Actually, chemical\nreactions involve the breaking and making of bonds between atoms to\nproduce new substances. You will study about types of bonds formed\nbetween atoms in Chapters 3 and 4. 1.2.1 Combination Reaction\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 11111.....44444\nn Take a small amount of calcium oxide\nor quick lime in a beaker. n Slowly add water to this. n Touch the beaker as shown in Fig. 1.3. n Do you feel any change in temperature?", "FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 11111.....33333\nFormation of slaked\nlime by the reaction of\nCalcium oxide reacts vigorously with water to produce slaked lime\ncalcium oxide with\nwater (calcium hydroxide) releasing a large amount of heat.

In Activity 1.4, we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved. This makes the reaction mixture warm. Reactions in which heat is\nreleased along with the formation of products are called exothermic\nchemical reactions. Other examples of exothermic reactions are –\n(i) Burning of natural gas\nCH (g) + 2O (g) → CO (g) + 2H O (g) (1.17)\n4 2 2 2\n(ii) Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process? We all know that we need energy to stay alive. We get this energy\nfrom the food we eat. During digestion, food is broken down into simpler\nsubstances. For example, rice, potatoes and bread contain\ncarbohydrates. These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose. This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides\nenergy.

In a decomposition\nreaction, a single substance decomposes to give two or more substances. n Reactions in which heat is given out along with the products are called exothermic\nreactions. n Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions. n When an element displaces another element from its compound, a displacement\nreaction occurs. n Two different atoms or groups of atoms (ions) are exchanged in double displacement\nreactions. n Precipitation reactions produce insoluble salts. n Reactions also involve the gain or loss of oxygen or hydrogen by substances. Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen\nor gain of hydrogen. E X E R C I S E S\n1.
