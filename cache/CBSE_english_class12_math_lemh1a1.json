Mathematical works do consist of proofs just as\npoems do consist of characters. v\n— VLADIMIR ARNOLD\nA.1.1 Introduction\nIn Classes IX, X and XI, we have learnt about the concepts of a statement, compound\nstatement, negation, converse and contrapositive of a statement; axioms, conjectures,\ntheorems and deductive reasoning. Here, we will discuss various methods of proving mathematical propositions. A.1.2 What is a Proof? Proof of a mathematical statement consists of sequence of statements, each statement\nbeing justified with a definition or an axiom or a proposition that is previously established\nby the method of deduction using only the allowed logical rules. Thus, each proof is a chain of deductive arguments each of which has its premises\nand conclusions. Many a times, we prove a proposition directly from what is given in\nthe proposition. But some times it is easier to prove an equivalent proposition rather\nthan proving the proposition itself. This leads to, two ways of proving a proposition\ndirectly or indirectly and the proofs obtained are called direct proof and indirect proof\nand further each has three different ways of proving which is discussed below. Direct Proof It is the proof of a proposition in which we directly start the proof with\nwhat is given in the proposition. (i) Straight forward approach It is a chain of arguments which leads directly from\nwhat is given or assumed, with the help of axioms, definitions or already proved\ntheorems, to what is to be proved using rules of logic. Consider the following example:\nExample 1 Show that if x2 – 5x + 6 = 0, then x = 3 or x = 2. Solution x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 (given)\nReprint 2025-26\n188 MATHEMATICS\n⇒ (x – 3) (x – 2) = 0 (replacing an expression by an equal/equivalent expression)\n⇒ x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0 (from the established theorem ab = 0 ⇒ either a = 0 or\nb = 0, for a, b in R)\n⇒ x – 3 + 3 = 0 + 3 or x – 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 (adding equal quantities on either side of the\nequation does not alter the nature of the\nequation)\n⇒ x + 0 = 3 or x + 0 = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition)\n⇒ x = 3 or x = 2 (using the identity property of integers under addition)\nHence, x2 – 5x + 6 = 0 implies x = 3 or x = 2. Explanation Let p be the given statement “x2 – 5x + 6 = 0” and q be the conclusion\nstatement “x = 3 or x = 2”. From the statement p, we deduced the statement r:“(x – 3) (x – 2) = 0” by\nreplacing the expression x2 – 5x + 6 in the statement p by another expression (x – 3)\n(x – 2) which is equal to x2 – 5x + 6. There arise two questions:\n(i) How does the expression (x – 3) (x – 2) is equal to the expression x2 – 5x + 6? (ii) How can we replace an expression with another expression which is equal to\nthe former? The first one is proved in earlier classes by factorization, i.e.,\nx2 – 5x + 6 = x2 – 3x – 2x + 6 = x (x – 3) –2 (x – 3) = (x – 3) (x – 2).", "The second one is by valid form of argumentation (rules of logic)\nNext this statement r becomes premises or given and deduce the statement s\n“ x – 3 = 0 or x – 2 = 0” and the reasons are given in the brackets. This process continues till we reach the conclusion. The symbolic equivalent of the argument is to prove by deduction that p ⇒ q\nis true. Starting with p, we deduce p ⇒ r ⇒ s ⇒ … ⇒ q. This implies that “p ⇒ q” is true. Example 2 Prove that the function f : R →→→→→ R\ndefined by f(x) =2x + 5 is one-one. Solution Note that a function f is one-one if\nf(x ) =f(x ) ⇒ x = x (definition of one-one function)\n1 2 1 2\nNow, given that f(x ) =f(x ), i.e., 2x + 5 = 2x + 5\n1 2 1 2\n⇒ 2x + 5 – 5 =2x + 5 – 5 (adding the same quantity on both sides)\n1 2\nReprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 189\n⇒ 2x + 0 =2x + 0\n1 2\n⇒ 2x =2x (using additive identity of real number)\n1 2\n2 2\n⇒ x = x (dividing by the same non zero quantity)\n2 1 2 2\n⇒ x = x\n1 2\nHence, the given function is one-one. (ii) Mathematical Induction\nMathematical induction, is a strategy, of proving a proposition which is deductive in\nnature. The whole basis of proof of this method depends on the following axiom:\nFor a given subset S of N, if\n(i) the natural number 1 ∈ S and\n(ii) the natural number k + 1 ∈ S whenever k ∈ S, then S = N. According to the principle of mathematical induction, if a statement “S(n) is true\nfor n = 1” (or for some starting point j), and if “S(n) is true for n = k” implies that “S(n)\nis true for n = k + 1” (whatever integer k ≥ j may be), then the statement is true for any\npositive integer n, for all n ≥ j. We now consider some examples. Example 3 Show that if\ncos θ sin θ  cos n θ sinn θ\nA =   , then An =  \n−sinθ cos θ −sin n θ cos n θ\nSolution We have\n cos n θ sinn θ\nP(n) : An =  \n−sin n θ cos n θ\ncos θ sin θ\nWe note that P(1) : A1 =  \n−sinθ cos θ\nTherefore, P(1) is true. Assume that P(k) is true, i.e.,\ncos k θ sin k θ\nP(k): Ak =  \n−sink θ cos k θ\nReprint 2025-26\n190 MATHEMATICS\nWe want to prove that P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true, i.e.,\ncos ( k +1) θ sin (k +1)θ\nP(k + 1) : Ak+1 =  \n−sin(k +1)θ cos (k +1)θ\nNow Ak+1 = Ak . A\nSince P(k) is true, we have\n cos k θ sin k θ  cos θ sin θ\nAk+1 =    \n −sink θ cos k θ  −sinθ cos θ\n cosk θcos θ −sin k θsin θ cosk θsin θ + sin k θcos θ \n=  \n−sin k θcos θ −cos k θsin θ −sin k θsin θ + cos k θcos θ\n(by matrix multiplication)\ncos ( k +1) θ sin (k +1)θ\n=  \n−sin(k +1)θ cos (k +1)θ\nThus, P(k + 1) is true whenever P(k) is true. Hence, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1 (by the principle of mathematical induction). (iii) Proof by cases or by exhaustion\nThis method of proving a statement p ⇒ q is possible only when p can be split into\nseveral cases, r, s, t (say) so that p = r ∨ s ∨ t (where “∨” is the symbol for “OR”). If the conditionals r ⇒ q;\ns ⇒ q;\nand t ⇒ q\nare proved, then (r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q, is proved and so p ⇒ q is proved.", "The method consists of examining every possible case of the hypothesis. It is\npractically convenient only when the number of possible cases are few. Example 4 Show that in any triangle ABC,\na =b cos C + c cos B\nSolution Let p be the statement “ABC is any triangle” and q be the statement\n“a =b cos C + c cos B”\nLet ABC be a triangle. From A draw AD a perpendicular to BC (BC produced if\nnecessary). As we know that any triangle has to be either acute or obtuse or right angled, we\ncan split p into three statements r, s and t, where\nReprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 191\nr : ABC is an acute angled triangle with ∠ C is acute. s : ABC is an obtuse angled triangle with ∠ C is obtuse. t : ABC is a right angled triangle with ∠ C is right angle. Hence, we prove the theorem by three cases. Case (i) When ∠ C is acute (Fig. A1.1). From the right angled triangle ADB,\nBD\n=cos B\nAB\ni.e. BD = AB cos B\n=c cos B\nFrom the right angled triangle ADC,\nFig A1.1\nCD\n=cos C\nAC\ni.e. CD = AC cos C\n=b cos C\nNow a =BD + CD\n=c cos B + b cos C ... (1)\nCase (ii) When ∠ C is obtuse (Fig A1.2). From the right angled triangle ADB,\nBD\n=cos B\nAB\ni.e. BD = AB cos B\n=c cos B\nFrom the right angled triangle ADC,\nCD\n= cos ∠ ACD\nAC\n= cos (180° – C)\n= – cos C\ni.e. CD = – AC cos C\n= – b cos C Fig A1.2\nReprint 2025-26\n192 MATHEMATICS\nNow a = BC = BD – CD\ni.e. a = c cos B – ( – b cos C)\na = c cos B + b cos C ... (2)\nCase (iii) When ∠ C is a right angle (Fig A1.3). From the right angled triangle ACB,\nBC\n=cos B\nAB\ni.e. BC =AB cos B\na =c cos B,\nand b cos C =b cos 900 = 0. Fig A1.3\nThus, we may write a =0 + c cos B\n=b cos C + c cos B ... (3)\nFrom (1), (2) and (3). We assert that for any triangle ABC,\na =b cos C + c cos B\nBy case (i), r ⇒ q is proved. By case (ii), s ⇒ q is proved. By case (iii), t ⇒ q is proved. Hence, from the proof by cases, (r ∨ s ∨ t) ⇒ q is proved, i.e., p ⇒ q is proved. Indirect Proof Instead of proving the given proposition directly, we establish the proof\nof the proposition through proving a proposition which is equivalent to the given\nproposition. (i) Proof by contradiction (Reductio Ad Absurdum) : Here, we start with the\nassumption that the given statement is false. By rules of logic, we arrive at a\nconclusion contradicting the assumption and hence it is inferred that the assumption\nis wrong and hence the given statement is true. Let us illustrate this method by an example. Example 5 Show that the set of all prime numbers is infinite. Solution Let P be the set of all prime numbers. We take the negation of the statement\n“the set of all prime numbers is infinite”, i.e., we assume the set of all prime numbers\nto be finite. Hence, we can list all the prime numbers as P , P , P ,..., P (say). Note\n1 2 3 k\nthat we have assumed that there is no prime number other than P , P , P ,..., P . 1 2 3 k\nNow consider N = (P P P …P) + 1... (1)\n1 2 3 k\nN is not in the list as N is larger than any of the numbers in the list. N is either prime or composite.", "Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 193\nIf N is a prime, then by (1), there exists a prime number which is not listed. On the other hand, if N is composite, it should have a prime divisor. But none of the\nnumbers in the list can divide N, because they all leave the remainder 1. Hence, the\nprime divisor should be other than the one in the list. Thus, in both the cases whether N is a prime or a composite, we ended up with\ncontradiction to the fact that we have listed all the prime numbers. Hence, our assumption that set of all prime numbers is finite is false. Thus, the set of all prime numbers is infinite. A\nNote Observe that the above proof also uses the method of proof by cases. (ii) Proof by using contrapositive statement of the given statement\nInstead of proving the conditional p ⇒ q, we prove its equivalent, i.e.,\n~ q ⇒ ~ p. (students can verify). The contrapositive of a conditional can be formed by interchanging the conclusion\nand the hypothesis and negating both. Example 6 Prove that the function f : R →→→→→ R defined by f(x) = 2x + 5 is one-one. Solution A function is one-one if f(x ) = f(x ) ⇒ x = x . 1 2 1 2\nUsing this we have to show that “2x+ 5 = 2x + 5” ⇒ “x = x ”. This is of the form\n1 2 1 2\np ⇒ q, where, p is 2x + 5 = 2x + 5 and q : x = x . We have proved this in Example 2\n1 2 1 2\nof “direct method”. We can also prove the same by using contrapositive of the statement. Now\ncontrapositive of this statement is ~ q ⇒ ~ p, i.e., contrapositive of “if f(x ) = f(x ),\n1 2\nthen x = x ” is “if x ≠x , then f(x ) ≠ f(x )”. 1 2 1 2 1 2\nNow x ≠x\n1 2\n⇒ 2x ≠2x\n1 2\n⇒ 2x + 5 ≠2x + 5\n1 2\n⇒ f(x ) ≠f(x ). 1 2\nSince “~ q ⇒ ~ p”, is equivalent to “p ⇒ q” the proof is complete. Example 7 Show that “if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular”. Solution Writing the above statement in symbolic form, we have\np ⇒ q, where, p is “matrix A is invertible” and q is “A is non singular”\nInstead of proving the given statement, we prove its contrapositive statement, i.e.,\nif A is not a non singular matrix, then the matrix A is not invertible. Reprint 2025-26\n194 MATHEMATICS\nIf A is not a non singular matrix, then it means the matrix A is singular, i.e.,\n|A| = 0\nadjA\nThen A–1 = does not exist as |A| = 0\n|A|\nHence, A is not invertible. Thus, we have proved that if A is not a non singular matrix, then A is not invertible. i.e., ~ q ⇒ ~ p. Hence, if a matrix A is invertible, then A is non singular. (iii) Proof by a counter example\nIn the history of Mathematics, there are occasions when all attempts to find a\nvalid proof of a statement fail and the uncertainty of the truth value of the statement\nremains unresolved. In such a situation, it is beneficial, if we find an example to falsify the statement. The example to disprove the statement is called a counter example. Since the disproof\nof a proposition p ⇒ q is merely a proof of the proposition ~ (p ⇒ q). Hence, this is\nalso a method of proof. Example 8 For each n,22n +1is a prime (n ∈ N).", "This was once thought to be true on the basis that\n221 +1\n=22 + 1 = 5 is a prime. 222 +1\n=24 + 1 = 17 is a prime. 223 +1 =28 + 1 = 257 is a prime. However, at first sight the generalisation looks to be correct. But, eventually it was\nshown that 225 +1 =232 + 1 = 4294967297\nwhich is not a prime since 4294967297 = 641 × 6700417 (a product of two numbers). So the generalisation “For each n, 22n +1 is a prime (n ∈ N)” is false. Just this one example 225 +1 is sufficient to disprove the generalisation. This is the\ncounter example. Thus, we have proved that the generalisation “For each n,22n +1 is a prime\n(n ∈ N)” is not true in general. Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 195\nExample 9 Every continuous function is differentiable. Proof We consider some functions given by\n(i) f(x) = x2\n(ii) g(x) = ex\n(iii) h(x) = sin x\nThese functions are continuous for all values of x. If we check for their\ndifferentiability, we find that they are all differentiable for all the values of x. This\nmakes us to believe that the generalisation “Every continuous function is differentiable”\nmay be true. But if we check the differentiability of the function given by “φ(x) = |x|”\nwhich is continuous, we find that it is not differentiable at x = 0. This means that the\nstatement “Every continuous function is differentiable” is false, in general. Just this\none function “φ(x) = |x|” is sufficient to disprove the statement. Hence, “φ(x) = |x|”\nis called a counter example to disprove “Every continuous function is differentiable”. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
