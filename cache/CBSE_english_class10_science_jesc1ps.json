The syllabi and textbooks developed\non the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt\nto discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning,\nnot as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates\nthe hard work done by the textbook development team responsible for this book. We\nwish to thank the Chairman of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor\nJ.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor Rupamanjari Ghosh, School\nof Physical Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, for guiding the work of\nthis committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we\nare grateful to them and their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to\nthe institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon\ntheir resources, material and personnel.", "We are especially grateful to the members of\nReprint 2025-26\nthe National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and\nHigher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairmanship\nof Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and\ncontribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous\nimprovement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions\nwhich will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement. Director\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\n(iv)\nReprint 2025-26\nRATIONALISATION OF CONTENT IN THE TEXTBOOK\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load\non students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing\nthe content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with\ncreative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the\nexercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes\nalready developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into\nconsideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the\nsame class\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much\ninterventions from teachers and can be learned by children through\nself-learning or peer-learning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the\nchanges given above. Reprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\nP R E F A C E\nThis textbook of Science for Class X is a continuation of our attempt in the Class IX\nScience textbook to comply with the guidelines of the National Curriculum\nFramework-2005. We had to work within a limited time frame and also had our own\nconstraints coming in the way of this radical change. The revised and re-structured\nsyllabus for Class X covers selected topics in the broad themes of — Materials,\nThe World of the Living, How Things Work, Natural Phenomena and Natural Resources. We have interpreted the syllabus to present a coherent coverage of scientific concepts\nrelated to our daily life on the select topics. It is an integrated approach to science at\nthis level, with no sharp divisions into disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology\nand Environmental Science. There has been a conscious attempt to address the relevant social concerns in this\nscience textbook wherever possible — the concerns for people with special needs, the\nissues of gender discrimination, energy and environment have found their natural\nplace in this book.", "Students have been encouraged to get into the debates on some of\nthe management concerns (for sustainable development, for example) so that they\ncan arrive at their own decisions after a scientific analysis of all the facts. This book has some features which are meant to enhance its effectiveness. The\ntheme of each chapter has been introduced with examples from daily life, and if possible,\nby a relevant activity that the students have to perform. The entire approach of the\nbook is, in fact, activity-based, i.e., the students are required to construct knowledge\nthemselves from these activities. The emphasis is not on definitions and technical\nterms, but on the concepts involved. Special care has been taken so that the rigour of\nscience is not lost while simplifying the language. Difficult and challenging ideas,\nwhich are not to be covered at this stage, have often been placed as extra material in\nthe boxes in light orange. The excitement of doing science comes from pursuing the\nunknown — the students would have the opportunity to think and explore somewhat\nbeyond the syllabus and may feel the urge to continue their scientific expedition at\nhigher levels. All such box items, including brief biography of scientists, are, of course,\nnon-evaluative. Solved examples are provided, wherever felt necessary, to clarify a concept. The\nin-text questions after a main section are for the students to check their understanding\nof the topic. At the end of each chapter, there is a quick review of the important points\ncovered in the chapter. We have introduced some multiple choice questions in the\nexercises. There are problems of different difficulty levels answers to the multiple-\nchoice questions and numericals, and hints for the difficult questions are included at\nthe end of the book. Reprint 2025-26\nThis book has been made possible because of the active participation of many\npeople. I wish to thank Professor Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, Prof. G. Ravindra,\nJoint Director, NCERT, and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education\nin Science and Mathematics, NCERT, specially for their keen interest in the development\nof the book and for all the administrative support. I wish to put on record my sincere\nappreciation for Dr Anjni Koul, the member-coordinator of the textbook development\ncommittee, for her extraordinary commitment and efficiency. It has been a real pleasure\nworking with my textbook development team and the review committee. The chosen\neditorial team worked extremely hard, on tight deadlines, to bring the book close to\nthe shape that we dreamt of. Fruitful discussions with some members of the MHRD\nMonitoring Committee helped in providing the final touches to the book. I do not have\nthe words to acknowledge the professional and personal inputs I received from some\nof my close friends during the preparation of this book. We warmly welcome comments\nand suggestions for improvement from our readers.", "RUPAMANJARI GHOSH\nProfessor of Physics\nSchool of Physical Sciences\nJawaharlal Nehru University\nNew Delhi\n(viii)\nReprint 2025-26\nTEXTBOOK DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE\nC , A G S M\nHAIRMAN DVISORY ROUP FOR TEXTBOOKS IN CIENCE AND ATHEMATICS\nJ.V.
