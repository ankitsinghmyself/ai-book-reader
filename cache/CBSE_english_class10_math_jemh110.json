["144 MATHEMATICS\n10\nC\nIRCLES\n10.1 Introduction\nYou have studied in Class IX that a circle is a collection of all points in a plane\nwhich are at a constant distance (radius) from a fixed point (centre). You have\nalso studied various terms related to a circle like chord, segment, sector, arc etc. Let us now examine the different situations that can arise when a circle and a line\nare given in a plane. So, let us consider a circle and a line PQ. There can be three possibilities given\nin Fig. 10.1 below:\nFig. 10.1\nIn Fig. 10.1 (i), the line PQ and the circle have no common point. In this case,\nPQ is called a non-intersecting line with respect to the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (ii), there\nare two common points A and B that the line PQ and the circle have. In this case, we\ncall the line PQ a secant of the circle. In Fig. 10.1 (iii), there is only one point A which\nis common to the line PQ and the circle. In this case, the line is called a tangent to the\ncircle. Reprint 2025-26\nCIRCLES 145\nYou might have seen a pulley fitted over a well which is used\nin taking out water from the well. Look at Fig. 10.2. Here the rope\non both sides of the pulley, if considered as a ray, is like a tangent\nto the circle representing the pulley. Is there any position of the line with respect to the circle\nother than the types given above? You can see that there cannot\nbe any other type of position of the line with respect to the circle. Fig. 10.2\nIn this chapter, we will study about the existence of the tangents\nto a circle and also study some of their properties. 10.2 Tangent to a Circle\nIn the previous section, you have seen that a tangent* to a circle is a line that\nintersects the circle at only one point. To understand the existence of the tangent to a circle at a point, let us perform\nthe following activities:\nActivity 1 : Take a circular wire and attach a straight wire AB at a point P of the\ncircular wire so that it can rotate about the point P in a plane. Put the system on a table\nand gently rotate the wire AB about the point P to get different positions of the straight\nwire [see Fig. 10.3(i)]. In various positions, the wire intersects the\ncircular wire at P and at another point Q or Q or\n1 2\nQ , etc. In one position, you will see that it will\n3\nintersect the circle at the point P only (see position\nAB of AB). This shows that a tangent exists at\nthe point P of the circle. On rotating further, you\ncan observe that in all other positions of AB, it will\nintersect the circle at P and at another point, say R\n1\nor R or R ,etc. So, you can observe that there is\n2 3\nonly one tangent at a point of the circle. Fig. 10.3 (i)\nWhile doing activity above, you must have observed that as the position AB\nmoves towards the position A B, the common point, say Q , of the line AB and the\n1\ncircle gradually comes nearer and nearer to the common point P. Ultimately, it coincides\nwith the point P in the position AB of AB. Again note, what happens if ‘AB’ is\nrotated rightwards about P?", "The common point R gradually comes nearer and nearer\n3\nto P and ultimately coincides with P. So, what we see is:\nThe tangent to a circle is a special case of the secant, when the two end\npoints of its corresponding chord coincide. *The word ‘tangent’ comes from the Latin word ‘tangere’, which means to touch and was\nintroduced by the Danish mathematician Thomas Fineke in 1583. Reprint 2025-26\n146 MATHEMATICS\nActivity 2 : On a paper, draw a circle and a\nsecant PQ of the circle. Draw various lines\nparallel to the secant on both sides of it. You\nwill find that after some steps, the length of\nthe chord cut by the lines will gradually\ndecrease, i.e., the two points of intersection of\nthe line and the circle are coming closer and\ncloser [see Fig. 10.3(ii)]. In one case, it\nbecomes zero on one side of the secant and in\nanother case, it becomes zero on the other side\nof the secant. See the positions PQ and PQ\nof the secant in Fig. 10.3 (ii). These are the\ntangents to the circle parallel to the given secant\nPQ. This also helps you to see that there cannot Fig. 10.3 (ii)\nbe more than two tangents parallel to a given\nsecant. This activity also establishes, what you must have observed, while doing\nActivity 1, namely, a tangent is the secant when both of the end points of the\ncorresponding chord coincide. The common point of the tangent and the circle is called the point of contact\n[the point A in Fig. 10.1 (iii)]and the tangent is said to touch the circle at the\ncommon point. Now look around you. Have you seen a bicycle\nor a cart moving? Look at its wheels. All the spokes\nof a wheel are along its radii. Now note the position\nof the wheel with respect to its movement on the\nground. Do you see any tangent anywhere? (See Fig. 10.4). In fact, the wheel moves along a line\nwhich is a tangent to the circle representing the wheel. Also, notice that in all positions, the radius through\nthe point of contact with the ground appears to be at\nright angles to the tangent (see Fig. 10.4). We shall Fig. 10.4\nnow prove this property of the tangent. Theorem 10.1 : The tangent at any point of a circle is perpendicular to the\nradius through the point of contact. Proof : We are given a circle with centre O and a tangent XY to the circle at a\npoint P. We need to prove that OP is perpendicular to XY. Reprint 2025-26\nCIRCLES 147\nTake a point Q on XY other than P and join OQ (see Fig. 10.5). The point Q must lie outside the circle. (Why? Note that if Q lies inside the circle, XY\nwill become a secant and not a tangent to the\ncircle). Therefore, OQ is longer than the radius\nOP of the circle. That is,\nOQ > OP. Since this happens for every point on the\nline XY except the point P, OP is the\nshortest of all the distances of the point O to the\npoints of XY. So OP is perpendicular to XY. (as shown in Theorem A1.7.) Fig. 10.5\nRemarks\n1. By theorem above, we can also conclude that at any point on a circle there can be\none and only one tangent. 2.", "The line containing the radius through the point of contact is also sometimes called\nthe ‘normal’ to the circle at the point. EXERCISE 10.1\n1. How many tangents can a circle have? 2. Fill in the blanks :\n(i) A tangent to a circle intersects it in point (s). (ii) A line intersecting a circle in two points is called a . (iii) A circle can have parallel tangents at the most. (iv) The common point of a tangent to a circle and the circle is called . 3. A tangent PQ at a point P of a circle of radius 5 cm meets a line through the centre O at\na point Q so that OQ = 12 cm. Length PQ is :\n(A) 12 cm (B) 13 cm (C) 8.5 cm (D) 119 cm. 4. Draw a circle and two lines parallel to a given line such that one is a tangent and the\nother, a secant to the circle. 10.3 Number of Tangents from a Point on a Circle\nTo get an idea of the number of tangents from a point on a circle, let us perform the\nfollowing activity:\nReprint 2025-26\n148 MATHEMATICS\nActivity 3 : Draw a circle on a paper. Take a\npoint P inside it. Can you draw a tangent to the\ncircle through this point? You will find that all\nthe lines through this point intersect the circle in\ntwo points. So, it is not possible to draw any\ntangent to a circle through a point inside it\n[see Fig. 10.6 (i)]. Next take a point P on the circle and draw\n(i)\ntangents through this point. You have already\nobserved that there is only one tangent to the\ncircle at such a point [see Fig. 10.6 (ii)]. Finally, take a point P outside the circle and\ntry to draw tangents to the circle from this point. What do you observe? You will find that you\ncan draw exactly two tangents to the circle\nthrough this point [see Fig. 10.6 (iii)]. We can summarise these facts as follows:\nCase 1 : There is no tangent to a circle passing\nthrough a point lying inside the circle. (ii)\nCase 2 : There is one and only one tangent to a\ncircle passing through a point lying on the circle. Case 3 : There are exactly two tangents to a\ncircle through a point lying outside the circle. In Fig. 10.6 (iii), T and T are the points of\n1 2\ncontact of the tangents PT and PT\n1 2\nrespectively. The length of the segment of the tangent\nfrom the external point P and the point of contact (iii)\nwith the circle is called the length of the tangent\nFig. 10.6\nfrom the point P to the circle. Note that in Fig. 10.6 (iii), PT and PT are the lengths of the tangents from P to\n1 2\nthe circle. The lengths PT and PT have a common property. Can you find this? 1 2\nMeasure PT and PT . Are these equal? In fact, this is always so. Let us give a proof\n1 2\nof this fact in the following theorem. Reprint 2025-26\nCIRCLES 149\nTheorem 10.2 : The lengths of tangents drawn\nfrom an external point to a circle are equal. Proof : We are given a circle with centre O, a\npoint P lying outside the circle and two tangents\nPQ, PR on the circle from P (see Fig. 10.7). We\nare required to prove that PQ = PR. For this, we join OP, OQ and OR.", "Then\n∠ OQP and ∠ ORP are right angles, because\nthese are angles between the radii and tangents,\nand according to Theorem 10.1 they are right Fig. 10.7\nangles. Now in right triangles OQP and ORP,\nOQ = OR (Radii of the same circle)\nOP = OP (Common)\nTherefore, ∆ OQP ≅ ∆ ORP (RHS)\nThis gives PQ = PR (CPCT)\nRemarks\n1. The theorem can also be proved by using the Pythagoras Theorem as follows:\nPQ2 = OP2 – OQ2 = OP2 – OR2 = PR2 (As OQ = OR)\nwhich gives PQ = PR. 2. Note also that ∠ OPQ = ∠ OPR. Therefore, OP is the angle bisector of ∠ QPR,\ni.e., the centre lies on the bisector of the angle between the two tangents. Let us take some examples. Example 1 : Prove that in two concentric circles,\nthe chord of the larger circle, which touches the\nsmaller circle, is bisected at the point of contact. Solution : We are given two concentric circles\nC and C with centre O and a chord AB of the\n1 2\nlarger circle C which touches the smaller circle\n1\nC at the point P (see Fig. 10.8). We need to prove\n2\nthat AP = BP. Let us join OP. Then, AB is a tangent to C at P Fig. 10.8\n2\nand OP is its radius. Therefore, by Theorem 10.1,\nOP ⊥ AB\nReprint 2025-26\n150 MATHEMATICS\nNow AB is a chord of the circle C and OP  AB. Therefore, OP is the bisector of the\n1\nchord AB, as the perpendicular from the centre bisects the chord,\ni.e., AP = BP\nExample 2 : Two tangents TP and TQ are drawn\nto a circle with centre O from an external point T. Prove that  PTQ = 2  OPQ. Solution : We are given a circle with centre O,\nan external point T and two tangents TP and TQ\nto the circle, where P, Q are the points of contact\n(see Fig. 10.9). We need to prove that\n PTQ = 2  OPQ Fig. 10.9\nLet  PTQ = \nNow, by Theorem 10.2, TP = TQ.

The tangents at P and Q\nintersect at a point T (see Fig. 10.10). Find the\nlength TP. Solution : Join OT. Let it intersect PQ at the\npoint R. Then  TPQ is isosceles and TO is the\nangle bisector of  PTQ. So, OT  PQ\nand therefore, OT bisects PQ which gives\nPR = RQ = 4 cm. Fig. 10.10\nAlso, OR = OP2  PR2  52 42 cm 3cm.
