They are further classified as follows:\nPrimary, secondary and tertiary alcohols: In these three types of\nalcohols, the –OH group is attached to primary, secondary and\ntertiary carbon atom, respectively as depicted below:\nAllylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached to\na sp3 hybridised carbon adjacent to the carbon-carbon double\nbond, that is to an allylic carbon. For example\nBenzylic alcohols: In these alcohols, the —OH group is attached\nto a sp3—hybridised carbon atom next to an aromatic ring. For\nexample.

The position of substituents are indicated\nby numerals. For this, the longest carbon chain (parent chain) is\nnumbered starting at the end nearest to the hydroxyl group.", "The positions\nof the –OH group and other substituents are indicated by using the\nnumbers of carbon atoms to which these are attached. For naming\npolyhydric alcohols, the ‘e’ of alkane is retained and the ending ‘ol’ is\nadded. The number of –OH groups is indicated by adding the\nmultiplicative prefix, di, tri, etc., before ‘ol’.

Fig. 7.1: Structures of methanol, phenol and methoxymethane\nChemistry 198\nReprint 2025-26\nThe bond angle in alcohols is slightly less than the tetrahedral\nangle (109°-28¢). It is due to the repulsion between the unshared\nelectron pairs of oxygen. In phenols, the –OH group is attached to sp2\nhybridised carbon of an aromatic ring. The carbon– oxygen bond\nlength (136 pm) in phenol is slightly less than that in methanol. This\nis due to (i) partial double bond character on account of the conjugation\nof unshared electron pair of oxygen with the aromatic ring\n(Section 7.4.4) and (ii) sp2 hybridised state of carbon to which oxygen\nis attached. In ethers, the four electron pairs, i.e., the two bond pairs and two\nlone pairs of electrons on oxygen are arranged approximately in a\ntetrahedral arrangement. The bond angle is slightly greater than the\ntetrahedral angle due to the repulsive interaction between the two\nbulky (–R) groups.

In case of\nunsymmetrical alkenes, the addition reaction takes place in\naccordance with Markovnikov’s rule.

Step 3: Deprotonation to form an alcohol.", "199 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nHydroboration - (ii) By hydroboration–oxidation: Diborane (BH ) reacts with alkenes\n3 2\noxidation was first to give trialkyl boranes as addition product. This is oxidised to\nreported by H.C. alcohol by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aqueous sodium\nBrown in 1959. For\nhydroxide. his studies on boron\ncontaining organic\ncompounds, Brown\nshared the 1979 Nobel\nprize in Chemistry\nwith G. Wittig. The addition of borane to the double bond takes place in such\na manner that the boron atom gets attached to the sp2 carbon\ncarrying greater number of hydrogen atoms. The alcohol so formed\nlooks as if it has been formed by the addition of water to the\nalkene in a way opposite to the Markovnikov’s rule. In this reaction,\nalcohol is obtained in excellent yield. 2. From carbonyl compounds\n(i) By reduction of aldehydes and ketones: Aldehydes and ketones\nare reduced to the corresponding alcohols by addition of\nhydrogen in the presence of catalysts (catalytic hydrogenation). The usual catalyst is a finely divided metal such as platinum,\npalladium or nickel.

The properties of alcohols and phenols are chiefly due\nto the hydroxyl group. The nature of alkyl and aryl groups simply\nmodify these properties. Boiling Points\nThe boiling points of alcohols and phenols increase with increase in the\nnumber of carbon atoms (increase in van der Waals forces). In alcohols,\nthe boiling points decrease with increase of branching in carbon chain\n(because of decrease in van der Waals forces with decrease in surface\narea). The –OH group in alcohols and phenols is involved in intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding as shown below:\nIt is interesting to note that boiling points of alcohols and phenols\nare higher in comparison to other classes of compounds, namely\nhydrocarbons, ethers, haloalkanes and haloarenes of comparable\nmolecular masses. For example, ethanol and propane have comparable\nmolecular masses but their boiling points differ widely. The boiling\npoint of methoxymethane is intermediate of the two boiling points.", "203 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nThe high boiling points of alcohols are mainly due to the presence\nof intermolecular hydrogen bonding in them which is lacking in ethers\nand hydrocarbons.

Protonated alcohols as electrophiles\nBased on the cleavage of O–H and C–O bonds, the reactions\nof alcohols and phenols may be divided into two groups:\nChemistry 204\nReprint 2025-26\n(a) Reactions involving cleavage of O–H bond\n1. Acidity of alcohols and phenols\n(i) Reaction with metals: Alcohols and phenols react with active\nmetals such as sodium, potassium and aluminium to yield\ncorresponding alkoxides/phenoxides and hydrogen. In addition to this, phenols react with aqueous sodium\nhydroxide to form sodium phenoxides. OH ONa\n+ NaOH + H O\n2\nSodium phenoxide\nThe above reactions show that alcohols and phenols are\nacidic in nature. In fact, alcohols and phenols are Brönsted\nacids i.e., they can donate a proton to a stronger base (B:). (ii) Acidity of alcohols: The acidic character of alcohols is due to\nthe polar nature of O–H bond. An electron-releasing group\n(–CH , –C H ) increases electron density on oxygen tending to\n3 2 5\ndecrease the polarity of O-H bond. This decreases the acid\nstrength. For this reason, the acid strength of alcohols decreases\nin the following order:\n205 Alcohols, Phenols and Ethers\nReprint 2025-26\nAlcohols are, however, weaker acids than water. This can be\nillustrated by the reaction of water with an alkoxide. This reaction shows that water is a better proton donor (i.e.,\nstronger acid) than alcohol. Also, in the above reaction, we note\nthat an alkoxide ion is a better proton acceptor than hydroxide\nion, which suggests that alkoxides are stronger bases (sodium\nethoxide is a stronger base than sodium hydroxide). Alcohols act as Bronsted bases as well. It is due to the\npresence of unshared electron pairs on oxygen, which makes\nthem proton acceptors.", "(iii) Acidity of phenols: The reactions of phenol with metals (e.g.,\nsodium, aluminium) and sodium hydroxide indicate its acidic\nnature. The hydroxyl group, in phenol is directly attached to\nthe sp2 hybridised carbon of benzene ring which acts as an\nelectron withdrawing group. Due to this, the charge distribution\nin phenol molecule, as depicted in its resonance structures,\ncauses the oxygen of –OH group to be positive. The reaction of phenol with aqueous sodium hydroxide\nindicates that phenols are stronger acids than alcohols and water. Let us examine how a compound in which hydroxyl group\nattached to an aromatic ring is more acidic than the one in\nwhich hydroxyl group is attached to an alkyl group. The ionisation of an alcohol and a phenol takes place as follows:\nDue to the higher electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nof phenol to which –OH is attached, electron density decreases\non oxygen. This increases the polarity of O–H bond and results\nin an increase in ionisation of phenols than that of alcohols. Now let us examine the stabilities of alkoxide and phenoxide\nions. In alkoxide ion, the negative charge is localised on oxygen\nwhile in phenoxide ion, the charge is delocalised. The delocalisation of negative charge (structures I-V) makes\nChemistry 206\nReprint 2025-26\nphenoxide ion more stable and favours the ionisation of phenol. Although there is also charge delocalisation in phenol, its\nresonance structures have charge separation due to which the\nphenol molecule is less stable than phenoxide ion. In substituted phenols, the presence of electron withdrawing\ngroups such as nitro group, enhances the acidic strength of\nphenol. This effect is more pronounced when such a group is\npresent at ortho and para positions. It is due to the effective\ndelocalisation of negative charge in phenoxide ion when\nsubstituent is at ortho or para position. On the other hand,\nelectron releasing groups, such as alkyl groups, in general, do\nnot favour the formation of phenoxide ion resulting in decrease\nin acid strength. Cresols, for example, are less acidic than phenol. The greater the pK a Table 7.3: pK Values of some Phenols and Ethanol\na\nvalue, the weaker the\nacid.

Chemistry 210\nReprint 2025-26\n1. Electrophilic aromatic substitution\nIn phenols, the reactions that take place on the aromatic ring are\nelectrophilic substitution reactions (Unit 9, Class XI). The –OH group\nattached to the benzene ring activates it towards electrophilic\nsubstitution. Also, it directs the incoming group to ortho and para\npositions in the ring as these positions become electron rich due to\nthe resonance effect caused by –OH group. The resonance structures\nare shown under acidity of phenols. Common electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions taking place\nin phenol are as follows:\n(i) Nitration: With dilute nitric acid at low temperature (298 K),\nphenol yields a mixture of ortho and para nitrophenols. The ortho and para isomers can be separated by steam\ndistillation. o-Nitrophenol is steam volatile due to intramolecular\nhydrogen bonding while p-nitrophenol is less volatile due to\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding which causes the association\nof molecules.", "2, 4, 6 - Trinitrophenol\nis a strong acid due to\nthe presence of three\nWith concentrated nitric acid, phenol is converted to\nelectron withdrawing\n2,4,6-trinitrophenol.

Reimer-Tiemann reaction\nOn treating phenol with chloroform in the presence of sodium\nhydroxide, a –CHO group is introduced at ortho position of benzene\nring. This reaction is known as Reimer - Tiemann reaction. The intermediate substituted benzal chloride is hydrolysed in the\npresence of alkali to produce salicylaldehyde. 4.

At 413 K, ethoxyethane is the main product. Diethyl ether has been\nused widely as an\ninhalation anaesthetic. But due to its slow\neffect and an\nunpleasant recovery The formation of ether is a nucleophilic bimolecular reaction (S 2)\nN\nperiod, it has been involving the attack of alcohol molecule on a protonated alcohol, as\nreplaced, as an indicated below:\nanaesthetic, by other\ncompounds. Acidic dehydration of alcohols, to give an alkene is also associated\nwith substitution reaction to give an ether. The method is suitable for the preparation of ethers having\nprimary alkyl groups only. The alkyl group should be unhindered\nand the temperature be kept low. Otherwise the reaction favours the\nformation of alkene. The reaction follows S 1 pathway when the alcohol\nN\nis secondary or tertiary about which you will learn in higher classes. However, the dehydration of secondary and tertiary alcohols to give\ncorresponding ethers is unsuccessful as elimination competes over\nsubstitution and as a consequence, alkenes are easily formed.

Cleavage of C–O bond in ethers\n7.6.3 Chemical\nReactions Ethers are the least reactive of the functional groups. The cleavage of\nC-O bond in ethers takes place under drastic conditions with excess\nof hydrogen halides. The reaction of dialkyl ether gives two alkyl\nhalide molecules. Alkyl aryl ethers are cleaved at the alkyl-oxygen bond due to the\nmore stable aryl-oxygen bond. The reaction yields phenol and alkyl\nhalide. Ethers with two different alkyl groups are also cleaved in the same\nmanner. The order of reactivity of hydrogen halides is as follows:\nHI > HBr > HCl.
