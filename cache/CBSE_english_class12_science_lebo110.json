Medicine\nThe applications of biotechnology include therapeutics,\n10.3 Transgenic Animals diagnostics, genetically modified crops for agriculture,\nprocessed food, bioremediation, waste treatment, and\n10.4 Ethical Issues\nenergy production. Three critical research areas of\nbiotechnology are:\n(i) Providing the best catalyst in the form of improved\norganism usually a microbe or pure enzyme. (ii) Creating optimal conditions through engineering for\na catalyst to act, and\n(iii) Downstream processing technologies to purify the\nprotein/organic compound. Let us now learn how human beings have used\nbiotechnology to improve the quality of human life,\nespecially in the field of food production and health. 10.1 B A\nIOTECHNOLOGICAL PPLICATIONS IN\nA\nGRICULTURE\nLet us take a look at the three options that can be thought\nfor increasing food production\n(i) agro-chemical based agriculture;\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n(ii) organic agriculture; and\n(iii) genetically engineered crop-based agriculture. The Green Revolution succeeded in tripling the food supply but yet\nit was not enough to feed the growing human population. Increased yields\nhave partly been due to the use of improved crop varieties, but mainly\ndue to the use of better management practices and use of agrochemicals\n(fertilisers and pesticides). However, for farmers in the developing world,\nagrochemicals are often too expensive, and further increases in yield with\nexisting varieties are not possible using conventional breeding. As traditional breeding techniques failed to keep pace with demand and\nto provide sufficiently fast and efficient systems for crop improvement,\nanother technology called tissue culture got developed. What does\ntissue culture mean? It was learnt by scientists, during 1950s, that\nwhole plants could be regenerated from explants, i.e., any part of a\nplant taken out and grown in a test tube, under sterile conditions in\nspecial nutrient media. This capacity to generate a whole plant from\nany cell/explant is called totipotency. You will learn how to accomplish\nthis in higher classes. It is important to stress here that the nutrient\nmedium must provide a carbon source such as sucrose and also\ninorganic salts, vitamins, amino acids and growth regulators like auxins,\ncytokinins etc. By application of these methods it is possible to achieve\npropagation of a large number of plants in very short durations. This\nmethod of producing thousands of plants through tissue culture is\ncalled micro-propagation. Each of these plants will be genetically\nidentical to the original plant from which they were grown, i.e., they are\nsomaclones.", "Many important food plants like tomato, banana, apple,\netc., have been produced on commercial scale using this method. Try to\nvisit a tissue culture laboratory with your teacher to better understand\nand appreciate the process. Another important application of the method is the recovery of\nhealthy plants from diseased plants. Even if the plant is infected with a\nvirus, the meristem (apical and axillary) is free of virus. Hence, one\ncan remove the meristem and grow it in vitro to obtain virus-free plants. Scientists have succeeded in culturing meristems of banana, sugarcane,\npotato, etc. 178\nScientists have even isolated single cells from plants and after\ndigesting their cell walls have been able to isolate naked protoplasts\n(surrounded by plasma membranes). Isolated protoplasts from two\ndifferent varieties of plants – each having a desirable character – can be\nfused to get hybrid protoplasts, which can be further grown to form a\nnew plant. These hybrids are called somatic hybrids while the process\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\nis called somatic hybridisation. Imagine a situation when a protoplast\nof tomato is fused with that of potato, and then they are grown – to form\nnew hybrid plants combining tomato and potato characteristics. Well,\nthis has been achieved – resulting in formation of pomato; unfortunately\nthis plant did not have all the desired combination of characteristics for\nits commercial utilisation. Is there any alternative path that our understanding of genetics can\nshow so that farmers may obtain maximum yield from their fields? Is\nthere a way to minimise the use of fertilisers and chemicals so that their\nharmful effects on the environment are reduced? Use of genetically\nmodified crops is a possible solution. Plants, bacteria, fungi and animals whose genes have been altered by\nmanipulation are called Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO). GM\nplants have been useful in many ways. Genetic modification has:\n(i) made crops more tolerant to abiotic stresses (cold, drought, salt, heat). (ii) reduced reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops). (iii) helped to reduce post harvest losses. (iv) increased efficiency of mineral usage by plants (this prevents early\nexhaustion of fertility of soil). (v) enhanced nutritional value of food, e.g., golden rice, i.e., Vitamin ‘A’\nenriched rice. In addition to these uses, GM has been used to create tailor-made\nplants to supply alternative resources to industries, in the form of starches,\nfuels and pharmaceuticals. Some of the applications of biotechnology in agriculture that you will\nstudy in detail are the production of pest resistant plants, which could\ndecrease the amount of pesticide used. Bt toxin is produced by a\nbacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt for short). Bt toxin gene has\nbeen cloned from the bacteria and been expressed in plants to provide\nresistance to insects without the need for insecticides; in effect created a\nbio-pesticide.", "Examples are Bt cotton, Bt corn, rice, tomato, potato and\nsoyabean etc. Bt Cotton: Some strains of Bacillus thuringiensis produce proteins that\nkill certain insects such as lepidopterans (tobacco budworm, armyworm),\ncoleopterans (beetles) and dipterans (flies, mosquitoes). B. thuringiensis\nforms protein crystals during a particular phase of their growth. These\ncrystals contain a toxic insecticidal protein. Why does this toxin not kill\n179\nthe Bacillus? Actually, the Bt toxin protein exist as inactive protoxins but\nonce an insect ingest the inactive toxin, it is converted into an active form\nof toxin due to the alkaline pH of the gut which solubilise the crystals. The activated toxin binds to the surface of midgut epithelial cells and\ncreate pores that cause cell swelling and lysis and eventually cause death\nof the insect. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nSpecific Bt toxin genes were isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis and\nincorporated into the several crop plants such as cotton (Figure 10.1). The choice of genes depends upon the crop and the targeted pest, as\nmost Bt toxins are insect-group specific. The toxin is coded by a gene\ncryIAc named cry. There are a number of them, for example, the proteins\nencoded by the genes cryIAc and cryIIAb control the cotton bollworms,\nthat of cryIAb controls corn borer. (a)\n(b)\nFigure 10.1 Cotton boll: (a) destroyed by bollworms; (b) a fully mature\ncotton boll\nPest Resistant Plants: Several nematodes parasitise a wide variety of\nplants and animals including human beings. A nematode Meloidegyne\nincognitia infects the roots of tobacco plants and causes a great reduction\nin yield. A novel strategy was adopted to prevent this infestation which\nwas based on the process of RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi takes place\nin all eukaryotic organisms as a method of cellular defense. This method\ninvolves silencing of a specific mRNA due to a complementary dsRNA\nmolecule that binds to and prevents translation of the mRNA (silencing). The source of this complementary RNA could be from an infection by\nviruses having RNA genomes or mobile genetic elements (transposons)\nthat replicate via an RNA intermediate. Using Agrobacterium vectors, nematode-specific genes were\nintroduced into the host plant (Figure 10.2). The introduction of DNA\n180\nwas such that it produced both sense and anti-sense RNA in the host\ncells. These two RNA’s being complementary to each other formed a double\nstranded (dsRNA) that initiated RNAi and thus, silenced the specific mRNA\nof the nematode. The consequence was that the parasite could not survive\nin a transgenic host expressing specific interfering RNA. The transgenic\nplant therefore got itself protected from the parasite (Figure 10.2).", "Reprint 2025-26\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\n(a) (b)\nFigure 10.2 Host plant-generated dsRNA triggers protection against nematode infestation:\n(a) Roots of a typical control plants; (b) transgenic plant roots 5 days after deliberate\ninfection of nematode but protected through novel mechanism. 10.2 B A M\nIOTECHNOLOGICAL PPLICATIONS IN EDICINE\nThe recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense impact\nin the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe and more\neffective therapeutic drugs. Further, the recombinant therapeutics do not\ninduce unwanted immunological responses as is common in case of\nsimilar products isolated from non-human sources. At present, about\n30 recombinant therapeutics have been approved for human-use the\nworld over. In India, 12 of these are presently being marketed. 10.2.1 Genetically Engineered Insulin\nManagement of adult-onset diabetes is possible by taking insulin at\nregular time intervals. What would a diabetic patient do if enough human-\ninsulin was not available? If you discuss this, you would soon realise\nthat one would have to isolate and use insulin from other animals. Would\nthe insulin isolated from other animals be just as effective as that\nsecreted by the human body itself and would it not elicit an immune\nresponse in the human body? Now, imagine if bacterium were available\nthat could make human insulin. Suddenly the whole process becomes\nso simple. You can easily grow a large quantity of the bacteria and make\nas much insulin as you need. Think about whether insulin can be orally administered to diabetic 181\npeople or not. Why? Insulin used for diabetes was earlier extracted from pancreas of\nslaughtered cattle and pigs. Insulin from an animal source, though caused\nsome patients to develop allergy or other types of reactions to the foreign\nprotein. Insulin consists of two short polypeptide chains: chain A\nand chain B, that are linked together by disulphide bridges (Figure 10.3). Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nIn mammals, including humans, insulin is synthesised\nas a pro-hormone (like a pro-enzyme, the pro-hormone\nalso needs to be processed before it becomes a fully mature\nand functional hormone) which contains an extra stretch\ncalled the C peptide. This C peptide is not present in the\nmature insulin and is removed during maturation into\ninsulin.The main challenge for production of insulin using\nrDNA techniques was getting insulin assembled into a\nmature form. In 1983, Eli Lilly an American company\nprepared two DNA sequences corresponding to A and B,\nchains of human insulin and introduced them in plasmids\nof E. coli to produce insulin chains. Chains A and B were\nFigure 10.3Maturation of\nproduced separately, extracted and combined by creating\npro-insulin into insulin\ndisulfide bonds to form human insulin. (simplified)\n10.2.2 Gene Therapy\nIf a person is born with a hereditary disease, can a corrective therapy\nbe taken for such a disease? Gene therapy is an attempt to do this.", "Gene therapy is a collection of methods that allows correction of a\ngene defect that has been diagnosed in a child/embryo. Here genes\nare inserted into a person’s cells and tissues to treat a disease. Correction of a genetic defect involves delivery of a normal gene into\nthe individual or embryo to take over the function of and compensate\nfor the non-functional gene. The first clinical gene therapy was given in 1990 to a 4-year old girl\nwith adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency. This enzyme is crucial for\nthe immune system to function. The disorder is caused due to the deletion\nof the gene for adenosine deaminase. In some children ADA deficiency\ncan be cured by bone marrow transplantation; in others it can be treated\nby enzyme replacement therapy, in which functional ADA is given to the\npatient by injection. But the problem with both of these approaches that\nthey are not completely curative. As a first step towards gene therapy,\nlymphocytes from the blood of the patient are grown in a culture outside\nthe body. A functional ADA cDNA (using a retroviral vector) is then\nintroduced into these lymphocytes, which are subsequently returned to\nthe patient. However, as these cells are not immortal, the patient requires\nperiodic infusion of such genetically engineered lymphocytes. However, if\nthe gene isolate from marrow cells producing ADA is introduced into cells\n182 at early embryonic stages, it could be a permanent cure. 10.2.3 Molecular Diagnosis\nYou know that for effective treatment of a disease, early diagnosis and\nunderstanding its pathophysiology is very important. Using conventional\nmethods of diagnosis (serum and urine analysis, etc.) early detection is\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\nnot possible. Recombinant DNA technology, Polymerase Chain Reaction\n(PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immuno-sorbent Assay (ELISA) are some of\nthe techniques that serve the purpose of early diagnosis. Presence of a pathogen (bacteria, viruses, etc.) is normally suspected\nonly when the pathogen has produced a disease symptom. By this time\nthe concentration of pathogen is already very high in the body. However,\nvery low concentration of a bacteria or virus (at a time when the symptoms\nof the disease are not yet visible) can be detected by amplification of their\nnucleic acid by PCR. Can you explain how PCR can detect very low\namounts of DNA? PCR is now routinely used to detect HIV in suspected\nAIDS patients. It is being used to detect mutations in genes in suspected\ncancer patients too. It is a powerful techqnique to identify many other\ngenetic disorders. A single stranded DNA or RNA, tagged with a radioactive molecule\n(probe) is allowed to hybridise to its complementary DNA in a clone of\ncells followed by detection using autoradiography. The clone having the\nmutated gene will hence not appear on the photographic film, because\nthe probe will not have complementarity with the mutated gene. ELISA is based on the principle of antigen-antibody interaction.", "Infection by pathogen can be detected by the presence of antigens\n(proteins, glycoproteins, etc.) or by detecting the antibodies synthesised\nagainst the pathogen. 10.3 T A\nRANSGENIC NIMALS\nAnimals that have had their DNA manipulated to possess and express an\nextra (foreign) gene are known as transgenic animals. Transgenic rats,\nrabbits, pigs, sheep, cows and fish have been produced, although over\n95 per cent of all existing transgenic animals are mice. Why are these\nanimals being produced? How can man benefit from such modifications? Let us try and explore some of the common reasons:\n(i) Normal physiology and development: Transgenic animals can\nbe specifically designed to allow the study of how genes are\nregulated, and how they affect the normal functions of the body\nand its development, e.g., study of complex factors involved in growth\nsuch as insulin-like growth factor. By introducing genes from other\nspecies that alter the formation of this factor and studying the\nbiological effects that result, information is obtained about the\nbiological role of the factor in the body. 183\n(ii) Study of disease: Many transgenic animals are designed to increase\nour understanding of how genes contribute to the development of\ndisease. These are specially made to serve as models for human\ndiseases so that investigation of new treatments for diseases is made\npossible. Today transgenic models exist for many human diseases\nsuch as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer’s. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n(iii) Biological products: Medicines required to treat certain human\ndiseases can contain biological products, but such products are\noften expensive to make. Transgenic animals that produce useful\nbiological products can be created by the introduction of the portion\nof DNA (or genes) which codes for a particular product such as\nhuman protein (α-1-antitrypsin) used to treat emphysema. Similar\nattempts are being made for treatment of phenylketonuria (PKU)\nand cystic fibrosis. In 1997, the first transgenic cow, Rosie, produced\nhuman protein-enriched milk (2.4 grams per litre). The milk\ncontained the human alpha-lactalbumin and was nutritionally a\nmore balanced product for human babies than natural cow-milk. (iv) Vaccine safety: Transgenic mice are being developed for use in\ntesting the safety of vaccines before they are used on humans. Transgenic mice are being used to test the safety of the polio vaccine. If successful and found to be reliable, they could replace the use of\nmonkeys to test the safety of batches of the vaccine. (v) Chemical safety testing: This is known as toxicity/safety testing. The procedure is the same as that used for testing toxicity of drugs. Transgenic animals are made that carry genes which make them more\nsensitive to toxic substances than non-transgenic animals. They are\nthen exposed to the toxic substances and the effects studied. Toxicity\ntesting in such animals will allow us to obtain results in less time.", "10.4 ETHICAL ISSUES\nThe manipulation of living organisms by the human race cannot go on\nany further, without regulation. Some ethical standards are required to\nevaluate the morality of all human activities that might help or harm living\norganisms. Going beyond the morality of such issues, the biological significance\nof such things is also important. Genetic modification of organisms can\nhave unpredicatable results when such organisms are introduced into\nthe ecosystem. Therefore, the Indian Government has set up organisations such as\nGEAC (Genetic Engineering Approval Committee), which will make\ndecisions regarding the validity of GM research and the safety of\nintroducing GM-organisms for public services. The modification/usage of living organisms for public services (as food\n184 and medicine sources, for example) has also created problems with patents\ngranted for the same. There is growing public anger that certain companies are being\ngranted patents for products and technologies that make use of the\ngenetic materials, plants and other biological resources that have long\nbeen identified, developed and used by farmers and indigenous people\nof a specific region/country. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS APPLICATIONS\nRice is an important food grain, the presence of which goes back\nthousands of years in Asia’s agricultural history. There are an estimated\n200,000 varieties of rice in India alone. The diversity of rice in India is\none of the richest in the world. Basmati rice is distinct for its unique\naroma and flavour and 27 documented varieties of Basmati are grown\nin India. There is reference to Basmati in ancient texts, folklore and\npoetry, as it has been grown for centuries. In 1997, an American\ncompany got patent rights on Basmati rice through the US Patent and\nTrademark Office. This allowed the company to sell a ‘new’ variety of\nBasmati, in the US and abroad. This ‘new’ variety of Basmati had\nactually been derived from Indian farmer’s varieties. Indian Basmati\nwas crossed with semi-dwarf varieties and claimed as an invention or\na novelty. The patent extends to functional equivalents, implying that\nother people selling Basmati rice could be restricted by the patent. Several attempts have also been made to patent uses, products and\nprocesses based on Indian traditional herbal medicines, e.g., turmeric\nneem. If we are not vigilant and we do not immediately counter these\npatent applications, other countries/individuals may encash on our\nrich legacy and we may not be able to do anything about it. BBBBBiiiiiooooopppppiiiiirrrrraaaaacccccyyyyy is the term used to refer to the use of bio-resources by\nmultinational companies and other organisations without proper\nauthorisation from the countries and people concerned without\ncompensatory payment. Most of the industrialised nations are rich financially but poor in\nbiodiversity and traditional knowledge.", "In contrast the developing and\nthe underdeveloped world is rich in biodiversity and traditional\nknowledge related to bio-resources. Traditional knowledge related to\nbio-resources can be exploited to develop modern applications and\ncan also be used to save time, effort and expenditure during their\ncommercialisation. There has been growing realisation of the injustice, inadequate\ncompensation, and benefit sharing between developed and developing\ncountries. Therefore, some nations are developing laws to prevent such\nunauthorised exploitation of their bio-resources and traditional\nknowledge. The Indian Parliament has recently cleared the second amendment\nof the Indian Patents Bill, that takes such issues into consideration,\nincluding patent terms of emergency provisions, research, and\n185\ndevelopment initiatives. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nSUMMARY\nBiotechnology has given to humans several useful products by using\nmicrobes, plant, animals and their metabolic machinery. Techniques\nof tissue culture and somatic hybridisation offer vast potential for\nmanipulation of plants in vitro to produce new varieties. Recombinant\nDNA technology has made it possible to engineer microbes, plants\nand animals such that they have novel capabilities. Genetically\nModified Organisms have been created by using methods other than\nnatural methods to transfer one or more genes from one organism to\nanother, generally using techniques such as recombinant DNA\ntechnology. GM plants have been useful in increasing crop yields, reduce post-\nharvest losses and make crops more tolerant of stresses. There are\nseveral GM crop plants with improved nutritional value of foods and\nreduced the reliance on chemical pesticides (pest-resistant crops). Recombinant DNA technological processes have made immense\nimpact in the area of healthcare by enabling mass production of safe\nand more effective therapeutics. Since the recombinant therapeutics\nare identical to human proteins, they do not induce unwanted\nimmunological responses and are free from risk of infection as was\nobserved in case of similar products isolated from non-human sources. Human insulin is made in bacteria yet its structure is absolutely\nidentical to that of the natural molecule. Transgenic animals are also used to understand how genes\ncontribute to the development of a disease by serving as models for\nhuman diseases, such as cancer, cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis\nand Alzheimer’s. Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into an individual’s cells\nand tissues to treat diseases especially hereditary diseases. It does\nso by replacing a defective mutant allele with a functional one or\ngene targeting which involves gene amplification. Viruses that attack\ntheir hosts and introduce their genetic material into the host cell as\npart of their replication cycle are used as vectors to transfer healthy\ngenes or more recently portions of genes.", "The current interest in the manipulation of microbes, plants, and\nanimals has raised serious ethical questions.
