["TRIANGLES 73\n6\nT\nRIANGLES\n6.1 Introduction\nYou are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes. In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures\nare said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this\nchapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily\nthe same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)\nare called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and\napply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier. Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of\nsome long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have\nReprint 2025-26\n74 MATHEMATICS\nbeen measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights\nand distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is\nbased on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3\nand also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book). 6.2 Similar Figures\nIn Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all\nsquares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the\nsame side lengths are congruent. Now consider any two (or more)\ncircles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they\ncongruent? Since all of them do not\nhave the same radius, they are not\ncongruent to each other. Note that\nsome are congruent and some are not,\nbut all of them have the same shape. So they all are, what we call, similar. Two similar figures have the same\nshape but not necessarily the same\nsize. Therefore, all circles are similar. What about two (or more) squares or\ntwo (or more) equilateral triangles\n[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed\nin the case of circles, here also all\nsquares are similar and all equilateral\ntriangles are similar. From the above, we can say\nthat all congruent figures are\nsimilar but the similar figures need\nFig. 6.1\nnot be congruent. Can a circle and a square be\nsimilar? Can a triangle and a square\nbe similar? These questions can be\nanswered by just looking at the\nfigures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently\nthese figures are not similar. (Why?)\nFig. 6.2\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 75\nWhat can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS\n(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These figures appear to be similar but we cannot be\ncertain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and\nbased on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar\nor not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:\nFig. 6.3\nYou will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument\n(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs are\nsimilar? Yes,they are.", "What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same\nperson one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these\nphotographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are\nnot of the same shape. So, they are not similar. What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes\nfrom the same negative? You must have heard about the stamp size, passport size and\npostcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say\nof 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we\nconsider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line\n45  55\nsegment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be  or  of that of the line segment. 35  35\nThis really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged\n(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55). It can also be said that every line segment\nof the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,\nif you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments\nin the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)\nare always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular\nof two polygons. We say that:\nTwo polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their\ncorresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio (or proportion). Reprint 2025-26\n76 MATHEMATICS\nNote that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale\nfactor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that\nworld maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are\nprepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions. In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 1 : Place a lighted bulb at a\npoint O on the ceiling and directly below\nit a table in your classroom. Let us cut a\npolygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from\na plane cardboard and place this\ncardboard parallel to the ground between\nthe lighted bulb and the table. Then a\nshadow of ABCD is cast on the table. Mark the outline of this shadow as\nABCD (see Fig.6.4). Note that the quadrilateral ABCD is\nan enlargement (or magnification) of the\nquadrilateral ABCD. This is because of\nthe property of light that light propogates\nin a straight line. You may also note that\nFig. 6.4\nA lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C\nlies on OC and D lies on OD. Thus, quadrilaterals ABCD and ABCD are of the\nsame shape but of different sizes. So, quadrilateral ABCD is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say\nthat quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral ABCD.", "Here, you can also note that vertex A corresponds to vertex A, vertex B\ncorresponds to vertex B, vertex C corresponds to vertex C and vertex D corresponds\nto vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A A, B B,\nC C and D D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two\nquadrilaterals, you may verify that\n(i)  A =  A,  B =  B,  C =  C,  D =  D and\nAB BC CD DA\n(ii)    . AB BC CD DA\nThis again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are\nsimilar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding\nsides are in the same ratio (or proportion). Reprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 77\nFrom the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of\nFig. 6.5 are similar. Fig. 6.5\nRemark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this\nsecond polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third\npolygon. You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of\nFig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the\nsame ratio. Fig. 6.6\nSo, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two\nquadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the\nsame ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons\n(quadrilaterals) are not similar. Reprint 2025-26\n78 MATHEMATICS\nFig. 6.7\nThus, either of the above two conditions (i) and (ii) of similarity of two\npolygons is not sufficient for them to be similar. EXERCISE 6.1\n1. Fill in the blanks using the correct word given in brackets :\n(i) All circles are . (congruent, similar)\n(ii) All squares are . (similar, congruent)\n(iii) All triangles are similar. (isosceles, equilateral)\n(iv) Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (a) their corresponding\nangles are and (b) their corresponding sides are .(equal,\nproportional)\n2. Give two different examples of pair of\n(i) similar figures. (ii) non-similar figures. 3. State whether the following quadrilaterals are similar or not:\nFig. 6.8\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 79\n6.3 Similarity of Triangles\nWhat can you say about the similarity of two triangles? You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions\nfor the similarity of two triangles. That is:\nTwo triangles are similiar, if\n(i) their corresponding angles are equal and\n(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). Note that if corresponding angles of two\ntriangles are equal, then they are known as\nequiangular triangles. A famous Greek\nmathematician Thales gave an important truth relating\nto two equiangular triangles which is as follows:\nThe ratio of any two corresponding sides in\ntwo equiangular triangles is always the same. It is believed that he had used a result called\nthe Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as\nThales\nthe Thales Theorem) for the same.", "(640 – 546 B.C.)\nTo understand the Basic Proportionality\nTheorem, let us perform the following activity:\nActivity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one\narm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and\nB such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB. Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm\nAY at C (see Fig. 6.9). Also, through the point D, draw a line parallel\nto BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from\nFig. 6.9\nAD 3\nyour constructions that  ? Measure AE and\nDB 2\nAE AE 3\nEC. What about ? Observe that is also equal to . Thus, you can see that\nEC EC 2\nAD AE\nin  ABC, DE || BC and  . Is it a coincidence? No, it is due to the following\nDB EC\ntheorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):\nReprint 2025-26\n80 MATHEMATICS\nTheorem 6.1 : If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the\nother two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same\nratio. Proof : We are given a triangle ABC in which a line\nparallel to side BC intersects other two sides AB and\nAC at D and E respectively (see Fig. 6.10). AD AE\nWe need to prove that  . DB EC\nLet us join BE and CD and then draw DM  AC and\nEN  AB. Fig. 6.10\n1 1\nNow, area of  ADE (= base × height) = AD × EN. 2 2\nRecall from Class IX, that area of  ADE is denoted as ar(ADE). 1\nSo, ar(ADE) = AD × EN\n2\n1\nSimilarly, ar(BDE) = DB × EN,\n2\n1 1\nar(ADE) = AE × DM and ar(DEC) = EC × DM. 2 2\n1\nAD×EN\nar(ADE) 2 AD\nTherefore, =  (1)\nar(BDE) 1 DB\nDB×EN\n2\n1\nAE×DM\nar(ADE) 2 AE\nand =  (2)\nar(DEC) 1 EC\nEC×DM\n2\nNote that  BDE and DEC are on the same base DE and between the same parallels\nBC and DE. So, ar(BDE) = ar(DEC) (3)\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 81\nTherefore, from (1), (2) and (3), we have :\nAD AE\n=\nDB EC\nIs the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see\nAppendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:\nActivity 3 : Draw an angle XAY on your\nnotebook and on ray AX, mark points B , B ,\n1 2\nB , B and B such that AB = B B = B B =\n3 4 1 1 2 2 3\nB B = B B. 3 4 4\nSimilarly, on ray AY, mark points\nC , C , C , C and C such that AC = C C =\n1 2 3 4 1 1 2\nC C = C C = C C. Then join B C and BC\n2 3 3 4 4 1 1\n(see Fig. 6.11). Fig. 6.11\nAB AC 1\n1 1\nNote that = (Each equal to )\nBB CC 4\n1 1\nYou can also see that lines B C and BC are parallel to each other, i.e.,\n1 1\nB C || BC (1)\n1 1\nSimilarly, by joining B C , B C and B C , you can see that:\n2 2 3 3 4 4\nAB AC  2\n2 = 2   and B C || BC (2)\nB B C C  3 2 2\n2 2\nAB AC  3\n3 = 3   and B C || BC (3)\nB B C C  2 3 3\n3 3\nAB AC  4\n4 = 4   and B C || BC (4)\nB B C C  1 4 4\n4 4\nFrom (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a\ntriangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side. You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and\ntaking any number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at\nthe same result.", "Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of\nTheorem 6.1:\nReprint 2025-26\n82 MATHEMATICS\nTheorem 6.2 : If a line divides any two sides of a\ntriangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel\nto the third side. This theorem can be proved by taking a line DE such\nAD AE\nthat  and assuming that DE is not parallel\nDB EC\nto BC (see Fig. 6.12). If DE is not parallel to BC, draw a line DE\nparallel to BC.

BO DO\n6.4 Criteria for Similarity of Triangles\nIn the previous section, we stated that two triangles are similar, if (i) their corresponding\nangles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). That is, in  ABC and  DEF, if\n(i)  A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F and\nAB BC CA\n,\n(ii)   then the two triangles are similar (see Fig. 6.22). DE EF FD\nFig. 6.22\nReprint 2025-26\n86 MATHEMATICS\nHere, you can see that A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C\ncorresponds to F. Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as\n‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The\nsymbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘’ for\n‘is congruent to’ in Class IX. It must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, the\nsimilarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct\ncorrespondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of\nFig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we\ncan write  BAC ~  EDF. Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say\nABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding\nangles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios\nAB BC CA\nof their corresponding sides    ? Let us examine. You may recall that\nDE EF FD\nin Class IX, you have obtained some criteria for congruency of two triangles involving\nonly three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,\nlet us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving\nrelationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,\ninstead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following\nactivity:\nActivity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm\nand 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC\nand QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct\nangles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23). Fig. 6.23\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 87\nLet rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each\nother at D. In the two triangles ABC and DEF, you can see that\n B =  E,  C =  F and  A =  D. That is, corresponding angles of these two\ntriangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ?", "Note that\nBC 3 AB CA\n  0.6. What about and ? On measuring AB, DE, CA and FD, you\nEF 5 DE FD\nAB CA\nwill find that and are also equal to 0.6 (or nearly equal to 0.6, if there is some\nDE FD\nAB BC CA\nerror in the measurement). Thus,    You can repeat this activity by\nDE EF FD\nconstructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every\ntime, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion). This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles. Theorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their\ncorresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two\ntriangles are similar. This criterion is referred to as the AAA\n(Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of\nsimilarity of two triangles. This theorem can be proved by taking two\ntriangles ABC and DEF such that\n A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F\n(see Fig. 6.24)\nFig. 6.24\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ. So,  ABC   DPQ (Why ?)\nThis gives  B =  P =  E and PQ || EF (How?)\nDP DQ\nTherefore, = (Why?)\nPE QF\nAB AC\ni.e., = (Why?)\nDE DF\nAB BC AB BC AC\nSimilarly, = and so   . DE EF DE EF DF\nRemark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be\nequal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:\nReprint 2025-26\n88 MATHEMATICS\nIf two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another\ntriangle, then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles. You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively\nequal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are\nproportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the\nconverse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to\nthe sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us\nexamine it through an activity :\nActivity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,\nCA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25). Fig. 6.25\nAB BC CA 2\nSo, you have :   (each equal to )\nDE EF FD 3\nNow measure  A,  B,  C,  D,  E and  F. You will observe that\n A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F, i.e., the corresponding angles of the two\ntriangles are equal. You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides\nin the same ratio). Everytime you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal. It is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:\nTheorem 6.4 : If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to\n(i.e., in the same ratio of) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding\nangles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.", "This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side–Side–Side) similarity criterion for\ntwo triangles. This theorem can be proved by taking two triangles ABC and DEF such that\nAB BC CA\n  (< 1) (see Fig. 6.26):\nDE EF FD\nReprint 2025-26\nTRIANGLES 89\nFig. 6.26\nCut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ. DP DQ\nIt can be seen that = and PQ || EF (How?)\nPE QF\nSo,  P =  E and  Q =  F. DP DQ PQ\nTherefore, = =\nDE DF EF\nDP DQ BC\nSo, = = (Why?)\nDE DF EF\nSo, BC = PQ (Why?)\nThus,  ABC   DPQ (Why ?)\nSo,  A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F (How ?)\nRemark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding\nangles are equal and (ii) corresponding sides are in the same ratio is not sufficient for\ntwo polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can\nnow say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both\nthe conditions as one condition implies the other. Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in\nClass IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS\ncongruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to\nSAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity. Activity 6 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 2 cm,  A = 50°,\nAC = 4 cm, DE = 3 cm,  D = 50° and DF = 6 cm (see Fig.6.27). Reprint 2025-26\n90 MATHEMATICS\nFig. 6.27\nAB AC 2\nHere, you may observe that = (each equal to ) and  A (included\nDE DF 3\nbetween the sides AB and AC) =  D (included between the sides DE and DF). That\nis, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including\nthese angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,\n E and  F. You will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and\n C =  F. So, by AAA similarity criterion,  ABC ~  DEF. You may repeat this\nactivity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to\none angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional. Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion\nof similarity of triangles:\nTheorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other\ntriangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two\ntriangles are similar. This criterion is referred to as\nthe SAS (Side–Angle–Side)\nsimilarity criterion for two\ntriangles. As before, this theorem can\nbe proved by taking two triangles\nABC and DEF such that\nAB AC\n ( 1) and  A =  D\nDE DF\n(see Fig. 6.28). Cut DP = AB, DQ Fig. 6.28\n= AC and join PQ.

Example 4 : In Fig. 6.29, if PQ || RS, prove that  POQ ~  SOR.

Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar\nfigures. 2. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true. 3. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles\nare equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). 4. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in\ndistinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio. 5. If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the\nthird side. 6.", "If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in\nthe same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion). 7. If in two triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of\nthe other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion). Reprint 2025-26\n98 MATHEMATICS\n8. If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding\nangles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion). 9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including\nthese angles are in the same ratio (proportional), then the triangles are similar\n(SAS similarity criterion). A N R\nOTETOTHE EADER\nIf in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are\nproportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle,\nthen the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the\nRHS Similarity Criterion. If you use this criterion in Example 2, Chapter 8, the proof will become\nsimpler. Reprint 2025-26"]
