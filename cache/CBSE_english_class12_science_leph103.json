["Chapter Three\nCURRENT\nELECTRICITY\n3.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nIn Chapter 1, all charges whether free or bound, were considered to be at\nrest. Charges in motion constitute an electric current. Such currents occur\nnaturally in many situations. Lightning is one such phenomenon in\nwhich charges flow from the clouds to the earth through the atmosphere,\nsometimes with disastrous results. The flow of charges in lightning is not\nsteady, but in our everyday life we see many devices where charges flow\nin a steady manner, like water flowing smoothly in a river. A torch and a\ncell-driven clock are examples of such devices. In the present chapter, we\nshall study some of the basic laws concerning steady electric currents. 3.2 E C\nLECTRIC URRENT\nImagine a small area held normal to the direction of flow of charges. Both\nthe positive and the negative charges may flow forward and backward\nacross the area. In a given time interval t, let q be the net amount (i.e.,\n+\nforward minus backward) of positive charge that flows in the forward\ndirection across the area. Similarly, let q be the net amount of negative\n–\ncharge flowing across the area in the forward direction. The net amount\nof charge flowing across the area in the forward direction in the time\ninterval t, then, is q = q – q . This is proportional to t for steady current\n+ –\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nand the quotient\nq\nI = (3.1)\nt\nis defined to be the current across the area in the forward direction. (If it\nturn out to be a negative number, it implies a current in the backward\ndirection.)\nCurrents are not always steady and hence more generally, we define\nthe current as follows. Let DQ be the net charge flowing across a cross-\nsection of a conductor during the time interval Dt [i.e., between times t\nand (t + Dt)]. Then, the current at time t across the cross-section of the\nconductor is defined as the value of the ratio of DQ to Dt in the limit of Dt\ntending to zero,\nI( t)” D Q\nlim (3.2)\nDfit 0 D t\nIn SI units, the unit of current is ampere. An ampere is defined\nthrough magnetic effects of currents that we will study in the following\nchapter. An ampere is typically the order of magnitude of currents in\ndomestic appliances. An average lightning carries currents of the order\nof tens of thousands of amperes and at the other extreme, currents in\nour nerves are in microamperes. 3.3 E C C\nLECTRIC URRENTS IN ONDUCTORS\nAn electric charge will experience a force if an electric field is applied. If it is\nfree to move, it will thus move contributing to a current. In nature, free\ncharged particles do exist like in upper strata of atmosphere called the\nionosphere. However, in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged\nelectrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and\nare thus not free to move. Bulk matter is made up of many molecules, a\ngram of water, for example, contains approximately 1022 molecules. These\nmolecules are so closely packed that the electrons are no longer attached\nto individual nuclei.", "In some materials, the electrons will still be bound,\ni.e., they will not accelerate even if an electric field is applied. In other\nmaterials, notably metals, some of the electrons are practically free to move\nwithin the bulk material. These materials, generally called conductors,\ndevelop electric currents in them when an electric field is applied. If we consider solid conductors, then of course the atoms are tightly\nbound to each other so that the current is carried by the negatively\ncharged electrons. There are, however, other types of conductors like\nelectrolytic solutions where positive and negative charges both can move. In our discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the\ncurrent is carried by the negatively charged electrons in the background\nof fixed positive ions. Consider first the case when no electric field is present. The electrons\nwill be moving due to thermal motion during which they collide with the\nfixed ions. An electron colliding with an ion emerges with the same speed\nas before the collision. However, the direction of its velocity after the\ncollision is completely random. At a given time, there is no preferential\n82\ndirection for the velocities of the electrons. Thus on the average, the\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\nnumber of electrons travelling in any direction will be equal to the number\nof electrons travelling in the opposite direction. So, there will be no net\nelectric current. Let us now see what happens to such a\npiece of conductor if an electric field is applied. To focus our thoughts, imagine the conductor\nin the shape of a cylinder of radius R (Fig. 3.1). Suppose we now take two thin circular discs\nFIGURE 3.1 Charges +Q and –Q put at the ends\nof a dielectric of the same radius and put\nof a metallic cylinder. The electrons will drift\npositive charge +Q distributed over one disc because of the electric field created to\nand similarly –Q at the other disc. We attach neutralise the charges. The current thus\nthe two discs on the two flat surfaces of the will stop after a while unless the charges +Q\ncylinder. An electric field will be created and and –Q are continuously replenished. is directed from the positive towards the\nnegative charge. The electrons will be accelerated due to this field towards\n+Q. They will thus move to neutralise the charges. The electrons, as long\nas they are moving, will constitute an electric current. Hence in the\nsituation considered, there will be a current for a very short while and no\ncurrent thereafter. We can also imagine a mechanism where the ends of the cylinder are\nsupplied with fresh charges to make up for any charges neutralised by\nelectrons moving inside the conductor. In that case, there will be a steady\nelectric field in the body of the conductor. This will result in a continuous\ncurrent rather than a current for a short period of time. Mechanisms,\nwhich maintain a steady electric field are cells or batteries that we shall\nstudy later in this chapter.", "In the next sections, we shall study the steady\ncurrent that results from a steady electric field in conductors. 3.4 O ’ L\nHM S AW\nA basic law regarding flow of currents was discovered by G.S. Ohm in\n1828, long before the physical mechanism responsible for flow of currents\nwas discovered. Imagine a conductor through which a current I is flowing\nand let V be the potential difference between the ends of the conductor. Then Ohm’s law states that\nV (cid:181) I\nor, V = R I (3.3)\nwhere the constant of proportionality R is called the resistance of the\nconductor. The SI units of resistance is ohm, and is denoted by the symbol\nW. The resistance R not only depends on the material of the conductor\nbut also on the dimensions of the conductor. The dependence of R on the\ndimensions of the conductor can easily be determined as follows. FIGURE 3.2\nConsider a conductor satisfying Eq. (3.3) to be in the form of a slab of Illustrating the\nlength l and cross sectional area A [Fig. 3.2(a)]. Imagine placing two such relation R = rl/A for\na rectangular slab\nidentical slabs side by side [Fig. 3.2(b)], so that the length of the\nof length l and area\ncombination is 2l. The current flowing through the combination is the\nof cross-section A. same as that flowing through either of the slabs. If V is the potential\ndifference across the ends of the first slab, then V is also the potential\n83\ndifference across the ends of the second slab since the second slab is\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nidentical to the first and the same current I flows through\nboth. The potential difference across the ends of the\ncombination is clearly sum of the potential difference\nacross the two individual slabs and hence equals 2V.

(3.5) and (3.7), we have\nl\nR (cid:181) (3.8)\nA\nand hence for a given conductor\nl\nR=r\n(3.9)\nA\nwhere the constant of proportionality r depends on the material of the\nconductor but not on its dimensions. r is called resistivity. Using the last equation, Ohm’s law reads\nIrl\nV =I · R= (3.10)\nA\nCurrent per unit area (taken normal to the current), I/A, is called\ncurrent density and is denoted by j. The SI units of the current density\nare A/m2. Further, if E is the magnitude of uniform electric field in the\nconductor whose length is l, then the potential difference V across its\n84\nends is El. Using these, the last equation reads\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\nE l = j r l\nor, E = j r (3.11)\nThe above relation for magnitudes E and j can indeed be cast in a\nvector form. The current density, (which we have defined as the current\nthrough unit area normal to the current) is also directed along E, and is\nalso a vector j (””””” j E/E). Thus, the last equation can be written as,\nE = jr (3.12)\nor, j = s E (3.13)\nwhere s ”1/r is called the conductivity. Ohm’s law is often stated in an\nequivalent form, Eq. (3.13) in addition to Eq.(3.3). In the next section, we\nwill try to understand the origin of the Ohm’s law as arising from the\ncharacteristics of the drift of electrons. 3.5 D E O\nRIFT OF LECTRONS AND THE RIGIN\nR\nOF ESISTIVITY\nAs remarked before, an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed\nions, but after collision, it will emerge with the same speed but in random\ndirections. If we consider all the electrons, their average velocity will be\nzero since their directions are random. Thus, if there are N electrons and\nthe velocity of the ith electron (i = 1, 2, 3, ... N ) at a given time is v, then\ni\n1 (cid:229)N\nv =0\nN i (3.14)\ni=1\nConsider now the situation when an electric field is\npresent. Electrons will be accelerated due to this\nfield by\n–eE\na = (3.15)\nm\nwhere –e is the charge and m is the mass of an electron. Consider again the ith electron at a given time t. This\nelectron would have had its last collision some time\nbefore t, and let t be the time elapsed after its last\ni\ncollision. If v was its velocity immediately after the last\ni\ncollision, then its velocity V at time t is\ni\n- eE\nV = v + t (3.16)\ni i m i\nFIGURE 3.3 A schematic picture of\nsince starting with its last collision it was accelerated an electron moving from a point A to\n(Fig. 3.3) with an acceleration given by Eq. (3.15) for a another point B through repeated\ntime interval t. The average velocity of the electrons at collisions, and straight line travel\ni\ntime t is the average of all the V’s. The average of v’s is between collisions (full lines). If an\ni i\nelectric field is applied as shown, the\nzero [Eq.

The collisions of the electrons do not occur at\nopposite the electric field is visible. regular intervals but at random times. Let us denote by\nt, the average time between successive collisions. Then\n85\nat a given time, some of the electrons would have spent\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\ntime more than t and some less than t. In other words, the time t in\ni\nEq. (3.16) will be less than t for some and more than t for others as we go\nthrough the values of i = 1, 2 ..... N. The average value of t then is t\ni\n(known as relaxation time). Thus, averaging Eq. (3.16) over the\nN-electrons at any given time t gives us for the average velocity v\nd\n( ) ( ) eE ( )\nv ” V = v - t\nd i average i average m i average\neE eE\n= 0– t =- t (3.17)\nm m\nThis last result is surprising. It tells us that the\nelectrons move with an average velocity which is\nindependent of time, although electrons are\naccelerated. This is the phenomenon of drift and the\nvelocity v in Eq. (3.17) is called the drift velocity. d\nBecause of the drift, there will be net transport of\ncharges across any area perpendicular to E. Consider\na planar area A, located inside the conductor such that\nFIGURE 3.4 Current in a metallic the normal to the area is parallel to E (Fig. 3.4). Then\nconductor. The magnitude of current because of the drift, in an infinitesimal amount of time\ndensity in a metal is the magnitude of Dt, all electrons to the left of the area at distances upto\ncharge contained in a cylinder of unit |v |Dt would have crossed the area. If n is the number\nd\narea and length v . of free electrons per unit volume in the metal, then\nd\nthere are n Dt |v |A such electrons. Since each\nd\nelectron carries a charge –e, the total charge transported across this area\nA to the right in time Dt is –ne A|v |Dt. E is directed towards the left and\nd\nhence the total charge transported along E across the area is negative of\nthis. The amount of charge crossing the area A in time Dt is by definition\n[Eq. (3.2)] I Dt, where I is the magnitude of the current. Hence,\nI D =t + neA v D t (3.18)\nd\nSubstituting the value of |v | from Eq.

(3.21) in the\nvector form\nne2\nj= tE\n(3.22)\nm\nComparison with Eq. (3.13) shows that Eq. (3.22) is exactly the Ohm’s\n86\nlaw, if we identify the conductivity s as\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\nne2\ns = t\n(3.23)\nm\nWe thus see that a very simple picture of electrical conduction\nreproduces Ohm’s law. We have, of course, made assumptions that t\nand n are constants, independent of E. We shall, in the next section,\ndiscuss the limitations of Ohm’s law. Example 3.1 (a) Estimate the average drift speed of conduction\nelectrons in a copper wire of cross-sectional area 1.0 × 10–7 m2 carrying\na current of 1.5 A.", "Assume that each copper atom contributes roughly\none conduction electron. The density of copper is 9.0 × 103 kg/m3,\nand its atomic mass is 63.5 u. (b) Compare the drift speed obtained\nabove with, (i) thermal speeds of copper atoms at ordinary\ntemperatures, (ii) speed of propagation of electric field along the\nconductor which causes the drift motion. Solution\n(a) The direction of drift velocity of conduction electrons is opposite\nto the electric field direction, i.e., electrons drift in the direction\nof increasing potential. The drift speed v is given by Eq. (3.18)\nd\nv = (I/neA)\nd\nNow, e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, A = 1.0 × 10–7m2, I = 1.5 A. The density of\nconduction electrons, n is equal to the number of atoms per cubic\nmetre (assuming one conduction electron per Cu atom as is\nreasonable from its valence electron count of one).

For copper at 300 K, this is about 2 × 102 m/s. This\nfigure indicates the random vibrational speeds of copper atoms\nin a conductor. Note that the drift speed of electrons is much\nsmaller, about 10–5 times the typical thermal speed at ordinary\ntemperatures. EXAMPLE\n(ii) An electric field travelling along the conductor has a speed of\nan electromagnetic wave, namely equal to 3.0 × 108 m s–1\n(You will learn about this in Chapter 8). The drift speed is, in\n3.1\ncomparison, extremely small; smaller by a factor of 10–11. * See Eq.

How then\nis current established almost the instant a circuit is closed? (b) The electron drift arises due to the force experienced by electrons\nin the electric field inside the conductor. But force should cause\nacceleration. Why then do the electrons acquire a steady average\ndrift speed? (c) If the electron drift speed is so small, and the electron’s charge is\nsmall, how can we still obtain large amounts of current in a\nconductor? (d) When electrons drift in a metal from lower to higher potential,\ndoes it mean that all the ‘free’ electrons of the metal are moving\nin the same direction? (e) Are the paths of electrons straight lines between successive\ncollisions (with the positive ions of the metal) in the (i) absence of\nelectric field, (ii) presence of electric field? Solution\n(a) Electric field is established throughout the circuit, almost instantly\n(with the speed of light) causing at every point a local electron\ndrift.", "Establishment of a current does not have to wait for electrons\nfrom one end of the conductor travelling to the other end. However,\nit does take a little while for the current to reach its steady value. (b) Each ‘free’ electron does accelerate, increasing its drift speed until\nit collides with a positive ion of the metal. It loses its drift speed\nafter collision but starts to accelerate and increases its drift speed\nagain only to suffer a collision again and so on. On the average,\ntherefore, electrons acquire only a drift speed. 2.3 (c) Simple, because the electron number density is enormous,\n~1029 m–3. ELPMAXE (d) By no means. The drift velocity is superposed over the large\nrandom velocities of electrons. (e) In the absence of electric field, the paths are straight lines; in the\npresence of electric field, the paths are, in general, curved. 3.5.1 Mobility\nAs we have seen, conductivity arises from mobile charge carriers. In\nmetals, these mobile charge carriers are electrons; in an ionised gas, they\nare electrons and positive charged ions; in an electrolyte, these can be\nboth positive and negative ions. An important quantity is the mobility m defined as the magnitude of\nthe drift velocity per unit electric field:\n|v |\nm = d\n(3.24)\nE\nThe SI unit of mobility is m2/Vs and is 104 of the mobility in practical\nunits (cm2/Vs).

Materials and devices not obeying Ohm’s law in the form of Eq. (3.3)\nare actually widely used in electronic circuits. In this and a few\nsubsequent chapters, however, we will study the electrical currents in\nmaterials that obey Ohm’s law.", "3.7 R V M\nESISTIVITY OF ARIOUS ATERIALS\nThe materials are classified as conductors, semiconductors and insulators\n89\ndepending on their resistivities, in an increasing order of their values. Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nMetals have low resistivities in the range of 10–8 Wm to 10–6 Wm. At the\nother end are insulators like ceramic, rubber and plastics having\nresistivities 1018 times greater than metals or more. In between the two\nare the semiconductors. These, however, have resistivities\ncharacteristically decreasing with a rise in temperature. The resistivities\nof semiconductors can be decreased by adding small amount of suitable\nimpurities. This last feature is exploited in use of semiconductors for\nelectronic devices. 3.8 T D R\nEMPERATURE EPENDENCE OF ESISTIVITY\nThe resistivity of a material is found to be dependent on the temperature. Different materials do not exhibit the same dependence on temperatures. Over a limited range of temperatures, that is not too large, the resistivity\nof a metallic conductor is approximately given by,\nr = r [1 + a (T–T )] (3.26)\nT 0 0\nwhere r is the resistivity at a temperature T and r is the same at a\nT 0\nreference temperature T . a is called the temperature co-efficient of\n0\nresistivity, and from Eq. (3.26), the dimension of a is (Temperature)–1. For metals, a is positive. The relation of Eq. (3.26) implies that a graph of r plotted against T\nT\nwould be a straight line. At temperatures much lower than 0°C, the graph,\nhowever, deviates considerably from a straight line (Fig. 3.8). Equation (3.26) thus, can be used approximately over a limited range\nof T around any reference temperature T , where the graph can be\n0\napproximated as a straight line. \nFIGURE 3.8 FIGURE 3.9 Resistivity FIGURE 3.10\nResistivity r of r of nichrome as a Temperature dependence\nT T\ncopper as a function function of absolute of resistivity for a typical\nof temperature T. temperature T. semiconductor. Some materials like Nichrome (which is an alloy of nickel, iron and\nchromium) exhibit a very weak dependence of resistivity with temperature\n(Fig. 3.9). Manganin and constantan have similar properties. These\nmaterials are thus widely used in wire bound standard resistors since\n90\ntheir resistance values would change very little with temperatures.

We can qualitatively understand the temperature dependence of\nresistivity, in the light of our derivation of Eq. (3.23). From this equation,\nresistivity of a material is given by\n1 m\nr = =\n(3.27)\ns ne2t\nr thus depends inversely both on the number n of free electrons per unit\nvolume and on the average time t between collisions. As we increase\ntemperature, average speed of the electrons, which act as the carriers of\ncurrent, increases resulting in more frequent collisions. The average time\nof collisions t, thus decreases with temperature.", "In a metal, n is not dependent on temperature to any appreciable\nextent and thus the decrease in the value of t with rise in temperature\ncauses r to increase as we have observed. For insulators and semiconductors, however, n increases with\ntemperature. This increase more than compensates any decrease in t in\nEq.(3.23) so that for such materials, r decreases with temperature. Example 3.3 An electric toaster uses nichrome for its heating\nelement. When a negligibly small current passes through it, its\nresistance at room temperature (27.0 °C) is found to be 75.3 W.

The temperature coefficient\nof resistance of nichrome averaged over the temperature range\ninvolved, is 1.70 × 10–4 °C–1. Solution When the current through the element is very small, heating\neffects can be ignored and the temperature T of the element is the\n1\nsame as room temperature. When the toaster is connected to the\nsupply, its initial current will be slightly higher than its steady value\nof 2.68 A. But due to heating effect of the current, the temperature\nwill rise. This will cause an increase in resistance and a slight\ndecrease in current.

The electric potential at A and B are denoted by V(A)\nand V(B) respectively. Since current is flowing from A to B, V(A) > V(B)\nand the potential difference across AB is V = V(A) – V(B) > 0. In a time interval Dt, an amount of charge DQ = I Dt travels from A to\nB.

This is\nbecause of the collisions with ions and atoms during transit. During\ncollisions, the energy gained by the charges thus is shared with the atoms. The atoms vibrate more vigorously, i.e., the conductor heats up. Thus,\nin an actual conductor, an amount of energy dissipated as heat in the\nconductor during the time interval Dt is,\nDW = I VDt (3.31)\nThe energy dissipated per unit time is the power dissipated\nP = DW/Dt and we have,\n92 P = I V (3.32)\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\nUsing Ohm’s law V = IR, we get\nP = I 2 R = V 2/R (3.33)\nas the power loss (“ohmic loss”) in a conductor of resistance R carrying a\ncurrent I. It is this power which heats up, for example, the coil of an\nelectric bulb to incandescence, radiating out heat and light. Where does the power come from? As we have\nreasoned before, we need an external source to keep\na steady current through the conductor. It is clearly\nthis source which must supply this power. In the\nsimple circuit shown with a cell (Fig.3.11), it is the\nchemical energy of the cell which supplies this power\nfor as long as it can. The expressions for power, Eqs.

One obviously wants to minimise the power\nloss in the transmission cables connecting the power stations to homes\nand factories. We shall see now how this can be achieved. Consider a\ndevice R, to which a power P is to be delivered via transmission cables\nhaving a resistance R to be dissipated by it finally. If V is the voltage\nc\nacross R and I the current through it, then\nP = V I (3.34)\nThe connecting wires from the power station to the device has a finite\nresistance R . The power dissipated in the connecting wires, which is\nc\nwasted is P with\nc\nP = I2 R\nc c\nP2R\n= c (3.35)\nV2\nfrom Eq. (3.32).", "Thus, to drive a device of power P, the power wasted in the\nconnecting wires is inversely proportional to V 2. The transmission cables\nfrom power stations are hundreds of miles long and their resistance R is\nc\nconsiderable. To reduce P , these wires carry current at enormous values\nc\nof V and this is the reason for the high voltage danger signs on transmission\nlines — a common sight as we move away from populated areas. Using\nelectricity at such voltages is not safe and hence at the other end, a device\ncalled a transformer lowers the voltage to a value suitable for use. 3.10 C , , I R\nELLS EMF NTERNAL ESISTANCE\nWe have already mentioned that a simple device to maintain a steady\ncurrent in an electric circuit is the electrolytic cell. Basically a cell has\ntwo electrodes, called the positive (P) and the negative (N), as shown in\n93\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nFig. 3.12. They are immersed in an electrolytic solution. Dipped in\nthe solution, the electrodes exchange charges with the electrolyte. The positive electrode has a potential difference V (V > 0) between\n+ +\nitself and the electrolyte solution immediately adjacent to it marked\nA in the figure. Similarly, the negative electrode develops a negative\npotential – (V ) (V ‡ 0) relative to the electrolyte adjacent to it,\n– –\nmarked as B in the figure. When there is no current, the electrolyte\nhas the same potential throughout, so that the potential difference\nbetween P and N is V – (–V ) = V + V . This difference is called the\n+ – + –\nelectromotive force (emf) of the cell and is denoted by e. Thus\ne = V +V > 0 (3.36)\n+ –\nNote that e is, actually, a potential difference and not a force. The\nname emf, however, is used because of historical reasons, and was\ngiven at a time when the phenomenon was not understood properly. To understand the significance of e, consider a resistor R\nconnected across the cell (Fig. 3.12). A current I flows across R\nFIGURE 3.12 (a) Sketch of from C to D.

If however R is finite, I is not zero. In that case the potential difference\nbetween P and N is\nV = V + V – I r\n+ –\n= e – I r (3.38)\nNote the negative sign in the expression (I r) for the potential difference\nbetween A and B. This is because the current I flows from B to A in the\nelectrolyte. In practical calculations, internal resistances of cells in the circuit\nmay be neglected when the current I is such that e >> I r. The actual\nvalues of the internal resistances of cells vary from cell to cell. The internal\nresistance of dry cells, however, is much higher than the common\nelectrolytic cells. We also observe that since V is the potential difference across R, we\nhave from Ohm’s law\nV = I R (3.39)\n94 Combining Eqs.

The formulae we have derived earlier for series and parallel combinations\nof resistors are not always sufficient to determine all the currents and\npotential differences in the circuit. Two rules, called Kirchhoff’s rules,\nare very useful for analysis of electric circuits. Given a circuit, we start by labelling currents in each resistor by a\nsymbol, say I, and a directed arrow to indicate that a current I flows\nalong the resistor in the direction indicated. If ultimately I is determined\nto be positive, the actual current in the resistor is in the direction of the\narrow. If I turns out to be negative, the current actually flows in a direction\nopposite to the arrow. Similarly, for each source (i.e., cell or some other\nsource of electrical power) the positive and negative electrodes are labelled,\nas well as, a directed arrow with a symbol for the current flowing through\nthe cell. This will tell us the potential difference, V = V (P) – V (N) = e – I r\n[Eq. (3.38) between the positive terminal P and the negative terminal N; I\nhere is the current flowing from N to P through the cell]. If, while labelling\nthe current I through the cell one goes from P to N, then of course\nV = e + I r (3.60)\nHaving clarified labelling, we now state the rules and the proof:\n(a) Junction rule: At any junction, the sum of the currents entering\nthe junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction\n(Fig. 3.15). 97\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nThis applies equally well if instead of a junction of\nseveral lines, we consider a point in a line. The proof of this rule follows from the fact that\nwhen currents are steady, there is no accumulation\nof charges at any junction or at any point in a line. Thus, the total current flowing in, (which is the rate\nat which charge flows into the junction), must equal\nthe total current flowing out. (b) Loop rule: The algebraic sum of changes in\npotential around any closed loop involving\nresistors and cells in the loop is zero\nFIGURE 3.15 At junction a the current (Fig. 3.15). leaving is I + I and current entering is I .

There is, however, a clear symmetry in the\nproblem which we can exploit to obtain the equivalent resistance of\nthe network. The paths AA¢, AD and AB are obviously symmetrically placed in the\nnetwork. Thus, the current in each must be the same, say, I. Further,\nat the corners A¢, B and D, the incoming current I must split equally\ninto the two outgoing branches. In this manner, the current in all\nthe 12 edges of the cube are easily written down in terms of I, using\nKirchhoff’s first rule and the symmetry in the problem. Next take a closed loop, say, ABCC¢EA, and apply Kirchhoff’s second\nrule:\n–IR – (1/2)IR – IR + e = 0\nwhere R is the resistance of each edge and e the emf of battery.

In a general network, there will be no such simplification due to symmetry,\nand only by application of Kirchhoff’s rules to junctions and closed loops\n(as many as necessary to solve the unknowns in the network) can we rules:\nhandle the problem. This will be illustrated in Example 3.6. Example 3.6 Determine the current in each branch of the network\nshown in Fig. 3.17. EXAMPLE\n3.6\nFIGURE 3.17 99\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nSolution Each branch of the network is assigned an unknown current\nto be determined by the application of Kirchhoff’s rules. To reduce\nthe number of unknowns at the outset, the first rule of Kirchhoff is\nused at every junction to assign the unknown current in each branch. We then have three unknowns I , I and I which can be found by\n1 2 3\napplying the second rule of Kirchhoff to three different closed loops.

The bridge has\nfour resistors R , R , R and R . Across one pair of diagonally opposite\n1 2 3 4\npoints (A and C in the figure) a source is connected. This (i.e., AC) is\ncalled the battery arm. Between the other two vertices, B and D, a\ngalvanometer G (which is a device to detect currents) is connected. This\nline, shown as BD in the figure, is called the galvanometer arm. For simplicity, we assume that the cell has no internal resistance. In\ngeneral there will be currents flowing across all the resistors as well as a\ncurrent I through G. Of special interest, is the case of a balanced bridge\ng\nwhere the resistors are such that I = 0. We can easily get the balance\ng\ncondition, such that there is no current through G. In this case, the\n100\nKirchhoff’s junction rule applied to junctions D and B (see the figure)\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\nimmediately gives us the relations I = I and I = I . Next, we apply\n1 3 2 4\nKirchhoff’s loop rule to closed loops ADBA and CBDC. The first\nloop gives\n–I R + 0 + I R = 0 (I = 0) (3.62)\n1 1 2 2 g\nand the second loop gives, upon using I = I , I = I\n3 1 4 2\nI R + 0 – I R = 0 (3.63)\n2 4 1 3\nFrom Eq.

The Wheatstone bridge and its balance condition provide a practical\nmethod for determination of an unknown resistance. Let us suppose we\nhave an unknown resistance, which we insert in the fourth arm; R is\n4\nthus not known. Keeping known resistances R and R in the first and\n1 2\nsecond arm of the bridge, we go on varying R till the galvanometer shows\n3\na null deflection.

Current through a given area of a conductor is the net charge passing\nper unit time through the area. 2. To maintain a steady current, we must have a closed circuit in which\nan external agency moves electric charge from lower to higher potential\nenergy. The work done per unit charge by the source in taking the\ncharge from lower to higher potential energy (i.e., from one terminal\nof the source to the other) is called the electromotive force, or emf, of\nthe source. Note that the emf is not a force; it is the voltage difference\nbetween the two terminals of a source in open circuit. 3. Ohm’s law: The electric current I flowing through a substance is\nproportional to the voltage V across its ends, i.e., V (cid:181) I or V = RI,\nwhere R is called the resistance of the substance. The unit of resistance\nis ohm: 1W = 1 V A–1. 102\nReprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\n4. The resistance R of a conductor depends on its length l and\ncross-sectional area A through the relation,\nrl\nR=\nA\nwhere r, called resistivity is a property of the material and depends on\ntemperature and pressure. 5. Electrical resistivity of substances varies over a very wide range. Metals\nhave low resistivity, in the range of 10–8 W m to 10–6 W m. Insulators\nlike glass and rubber have 1022 to 1024 times greater resistivity. Semiconductors like Si and Ge lie roughly in the middle range of\nresistivity on a logarithmic scale. 6. In most substances, the carriers of current are electrons; in some\ncases, for example, ionic crystals and electrolytic liquids, positive and\nnegative ions carry the electric current. 7. Current density j gives the amount of charge flowing per second per\nunit area normal to the flow,\nj = nq v\nd\nwhere n is the number density (number per unit volume) of charge\ncarriers each of charge q, and v is the drift velocity of the charge\nd\ncarriers. For electrons q = – e. If j is normal to a cross-sectional area\nA and is constant over the area, the magnitude of the current I through\nthe area is nev A. d\n8.", "Using E = V/l, I = nev A, and Ohm’s law, one obtains\nd\neE ne2\n= r v\nm m d\nThe proportionality between the force eE on the electrons in a metal\ndue to the external field E and the drift velocity v (not acceleration)\nd\ncan be understood, if we assume that the electrons suffer collisions\nwith ions in the metal, which deflect them randomly.

In the temperature range in which resistivity increases linearly with\ntemperature, the temperature coefficient of resistivity a is defined as\nthe fractional increase in resistivity per unit increase in temperature. 10. Ohm’s law is obeyed by many substances, but it is not a fundamental\nlaw of nature. It fails if\n(a) V depends on I non-linearly. (b) the relation between V and I depends on the sign of V for the same\nabsolute value of V. (c) The relation between V and I is non-unique. An example of (a) is when r increases with I (even if temperature is\nkept fixed). A rectifier combines features (a) and (b). GaAs shows the\nfeature (c). 11.

The Wheatstone bridge is an arrangement of four resistances – R , R ,\n1 2\nR , R as shown in the text. The null-point condition is given by\n3 4\nR R\n1 = 3\nR R\n2 4\nusing which the value of one resistance can be determined, knowing\nthe other three resistances.

Current is a scalar although we represent current with an arrow. Currents do not obey the law of vector addition. That current is a\nscalar also follows from it’s definition. The current I through an area\nof cross-section is given by the scalar product of two vectors:\nI = j . DS\n104 where j and DS are vectors. Reprint 2025-26\nCurrent\nElectricity\n2. Refer to V-I curves of a resistor and a diode as drawn in the text. A\nresistor obeys Ohm’s law while a diode does not. The assertion that\nV = IR is a statement of Ohm’s law is not true.", "This equation defines\nresistance and it may be applied to all conducting devices whether\nthey obey Ohm’s law or not. The Ohm’s law asserts that the plot of I\nversus V is linear i.e., R is independent of V. Equation E = ρ j leads to another statement of Ohm’s law, i.e., a\nconducting material obeys Ohm’s law when the resistivity of the\nmaterial does not depend on the magnitude and direction of applied\nelectric field. 3. Homogeneous conductors like silver or semiconductors like pure\ngermanium or germanium containing impurities obey Ohm’s law within\nsome range of electric field values. If the field becomes too strong,\nthere are departures from Ohm’s law in all cases. 4. Motion of conduction electrons in electric field E is the sum of (i)\nmotion due to random collisions and (ii) that due to E. The motion\ndue to random collisions averages to zero and does not contribute to\nv (Chapter 10, Textbook of Class XI). v , thus is only due to applied\nd d\nelectric field on the electron. 5. The relation j = ρ v should be applied to each type of charge carriers\nseparately. In a conducting wire, the total current and charge density\narises from both positive and negative charges:\nj = ρ v + ρ v\n+ + – –\nρρρρρ = ρ + ρ\n+ –\nNow in a neutral wire carrying electric current,\nρρρρρ = – ρ\n+ –\nFurther, v ~ 0 which gives\n+\nρρρρρ = 0\nj = ρ v\n–\nThus, the relation j = ρ v does not apply to the total current charge\ndensity. 6. Kirchhoff’s junction rule is based on conservation of charge and the\noutgoing currents add up and are equal to incoming current at a\njunction. Bending or reorienting the wire does not change the validity\nof Kirchhoff’s junction rule. EXERCISES\n3.1 The storage battery of a car has an emf of 12 V.
