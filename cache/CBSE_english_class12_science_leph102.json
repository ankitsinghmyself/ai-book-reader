["Chapter Two\nELECTROSTATIC\nPOTENTIAL AND\nCAPACITANCE\n22222.....11111 IIIII\nNNNNNTTTTTRRRRROOOOODDDDDUUUUUCCCCCTTTTTIIIIIOOOOONNNNN\nIn Chapters 5 and 7 (Class XI), the notion of potential energy was\nintroduced. When an external force does work in taking a body from a\npoint to another against a force like spring force or gravitational force,\nthat work gets stored as potential energy of the body. When the external\nforce is removed, the body moves, gaining kinetic energy and losing\nan equal amount of potential energy. The sum of kinetic and\npotential energies is thus conserved. Forces of this kind are called\nconservative forces. Spring force and gravitational force are examples of\nconservative forces. Coulomb force between two (stationary) charges is also a conservative\nforce. This is not surprising, since both have inverse-square dependence\non distance and differ mainly in the proportionality constants – the\nmasses in the gravitational law are replaced by charges in Coulomb’s\nlaw. Thus, like the potential energy of a mass in a gravitational\nfield, we can define electrostatic potential energy of a charge in an\nelectrostatic field. Consider an electrostatic field EEEEE due to some charge configuration. First, for simplicity, consider the field EEEEE due to a charge Q placed at the\norigin. Now, imagine that we bring a test charge q from a point R to a\npoint P against the repulsive force on it due to the charge Q. With reference\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nto Fig. 2.1, this will happen if Q and q are both positive\nor both negative. For definiteness, let us take Q, q > 0. Two remarks may be made here. First, we assume\nthat the test charge q is so small that it does not disturb\nthe original configuration, namely the charge Q at the\norigin (or else, we keep Q fixed at the origin by some\nunspecified force). Second, in bringing the charge q from\nFIGURE 2.1 A test charge q (> 0) is\nmoved from the point R to the R to P, we apply an external force F just enough to\next\npoint P against the repulsive counter the repulsive electric force F (i.e, F = –F ). E ext E\nforce on it by the charge Q (> 0) This means there is no net force on or acceleration of\nplaced at the origin. the charge q when it is brought from R to P, i.e., it is\nbrought with infinitesimally slow constant speed. In\nthis situation, work done by the external force is the negative of the work\ndone by the electric force, and gets fully stored in the form of potential\nenergy of the charge q. If the external force is removed on reaching P, the\nelectric force will take the charge away from Q – the stored energy (potential\nenergy) at P is used to provide kinetic energy to the charge q in such a\nway that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies is conserved. Thus, work done by external forces in moving a charge q from R to P is\nW =\nRP\n–\n= (2.1)\nThis work done is against electrostatic repulsive force and gets stored\nas potential energy.", "At every point in electric field, a particle with charge q possesses a\ncertain electrostatic potential energy, this work done increases its potential\nenergy by an amount equal to potential energy difference between points\nR and P. Thus, potential energy difference\nD U= U - U= W (2.2)\nP R RP\n(Note here that this displacement is in an opposite sense to the electric\nforce and hence work done by electric field is negative, i.e., –W .)\nRP\nTherefore, we can define electric potential energy difference between\ntwo points as the work required to be done by an external force in moving\n(without accelerating) charge q from one point to another for electric field\nof any arbitrary charge configuration. Two important comments may be made at this stage:\n(i) The right side of Eq. (2.2) depends only on the initial and final positions\nof the charge. It means that the work done by an electrostatic field in\nmoving a charge from one point to another depends only on the initial\nand the final points and is independent of the path taken to go from\none point to the other. This is the fundamental characteristic of a\nconservative force. The concept of the potential energy would not be\nmeaningful if the work depended on the path. The path-independence\nof work done by an electrostatic field can be proved using the\n46 Coulomb’s law. We omit this proof here.

Clearly,\npotential energy so defined is undetermined to within an\nadditive constant.What this means is that the actual value\nof potential energy is not physically significant; it is only\nthe difference of potential energy that is significant. We can\nalways add an arbitrary constant a to potential energy at\nevery point, since this will not change the potential energy\ndifference:\n(U +a )- (U +a )= U - U\nP R P R\nPut it differently, there is a freedom in choosing the point\nwhere potential energy is zero.

For definiteness, take Q\nto be positive. We wish to determine the potential at any point P with\nposition vector r from the origin. For that we must\ncalculate the work done in bringing a unit positive\ntest charge from infinity to the point P. For Q > 0,\nthe work done against the repulsive force on the\ntest charge is positive.

Its total charge is zero. It is\ncharacterised by a dipole moment vector p whose magnitude is q × 2a\nand which points in the direction from –q to q (Fig. 2.5). We also saw that\nthe electric field of a dipole at a point with position vector r depends not\njust on the magnitude r, but also on the angle between r and p. Further, 49\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nthe field falls off, at large distance, not as\n1/r2 (typical of field due to a single charge)\nbut as 1/r3.", "We, now, determine the electric\npotential due to a dipole and contrast it\nwith the potential due to a single charge. As before, we take the origin at the\ncentre of the dipole. Now we know that the\nelectric field obeys the superposition\nprinciple. Since potential is related to the\nwork done by the field, electrostatic\npotential also follows the superposition\nprinciple. Thus, the potential due to the\ndipole is the sum of potentials due to the\ncharges q and –q\n(cid:230) (cid:246)\n1 q q\nFIGURE 2.5 Quantities involved in the calculation V = 4p ε Ł(cid:231) r - r ł(cid:247) (2.9)\n0 1 2\nof potential due to a dipole. where r and r are the distances of the\n1 2\npoint P from q and –q, respectively.

For a point dipole p at the origin, Eq. (2.15) is, however,\nexact. From Eq.

The potential in the\nequatorial plane (q = p/2) is zero. The important contrasting features of electric potential of a dipole\nfrom that due to a single charge are clear from Eqs. (2.8) and (2.15):\n(i) The potential due to a dipole depends not just on r but also on the\nangle between the position vector r and the dipole moment vector p. (It is, however, axially symmetric about p. That is, if you rotate the\nposition vector r about p, keeping q fixed, the points corresponding\nto P on the cone so generated will have the same potential as at P.)\n(ii) The electric dipole potential falls off, at large distance, as 1/r2, not as\n1/r, characteristic of the potential due to a single charge.

We then determine the potential due\nto each volume element and sum (strictly speaking , integrate) over all\nsuch contributions, and thus determine the potential due to the entire\ndistribution. We have seen in Chapter 1 that for a uniformly charged spherical shell,\nthe electric field outside the shell is as if the entire charge is concentrated\nat the centre. Thus, the potential outside the shell is given by\n1 q\nV = 4p e r (r ‡ R) [2.19(a)]\n0\nwhere q is the total charge on the shell and R its radius. The electric field\ninside the shell is zero. This implies (Section 2.6) that potential is constant\ninside the shell (as no work is done in moving a charge inside the shell),\nand, therefore, equals its value at the surface, which is\n1 q\nV = 4p e R [2.19(b)]\n0\nExample 2.2 Two charges 3 × 10–8 C and –2 × 10–8 C are located\n15 cm apart. At what point on the line joining the two charges is the\nelectric potential zero? Take the potential at infinity to be zero. Solution Let us take the origin O at the location of the positive charge. The line joining the two charges is taken to be the x-axis; the negative\ncharge is taken to be on the right side of the origin (Fig. 2.7). FIGURE 2.7\nLet P be the required point on the x-axis where the potential is zero. If x is the x-coordinate of P, obviously x must be positive.

For a single charge q, the potential is given\nby Eq. (2.8):\n1 q\nV =\n4p e r\no\nThis shows that V is a constant if r is constant. Thus, equipotential\nsurfaces of a single point charge are concentric spherical surfaces centred\nat the charge.

Clearly, the electric field at every point is normal to the equipotential surface\npassing through that point.

Let us calculate the work done\n1 2\n(externally) in building up this configuration. This means that we consider\nthe charges q and q initially at infinity and determine the work done by\n1 2\nan external agency to bring the charges to the given locations. Suppose,\nfirst the charge q is brought from infinity to the point r . There is no\n1 1\nexternal field against which work needs to be done, so work done in\nbringing q from infinity to r is zero.", "This charge produces a potential in\n1 1\nspace given by\n1 q\nV = 1\n1 4p ε r\n0 1P\nwhere r is the distance of a point P in space from the location of q . 1P 1\nFrom the definition of potential, work done in bringing charge q from\n2\ninfinity to the point r is q times the potential at r due to q :\n2 2 2 1\n1 q q\nwork done on q = 1 2\n2 4p ε r 55\n0 12\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nwhere r is the distance between points 1 and 2. 12\nSince electrostatic force is conservative, this work gets\nstored in the form of potential energy of the system. Thus,\nthe potential energy of a system of two charges q and q is\n1 2\nFIGURE 2.13 Potential energy of a 1 q q\nU = 1 2\nsystem of charges q and q is 4πε r (2.22)\n1 2 0 12\ndirectly proportional to the product\nObviously, if q was brought first to its present location and\nof charges and inversely to the 2\ndistance between them. q brought later, the potential energy U would be the same. 1\nMore generally, the potential energy expression,\nEq. (2.22), is unaltered whatever way the charges are brought to the specified\nlocations, because of path-independence of work for electrostatic force. Equation (2.22) is true for any sign of q and q . If q q > 0, potential\n1 2 1 2\nenergy is positive. This is as expected, since for like charges (q q > 0),\n1 2\nelectrostatic force is repulsive and a positive amount of work is needed to\nbe done against this force to bring the charges from infinity to a finite\ndistance apart. For unlike charges (q q < 0), the electrostatic force is\n1 2\nattractive. In that case, a positive amount of work is needed against this\nforce to take the charges from the given location to infinity. In other words,\na negative amount of work is needed for the reverse path (from infinity to\nthe present locations), so the potential energy is negative. Equation (2.22) is easily generalised for a system of any number of\npoint charges. Let us calculate the potential energy of a system of three\ncharges q ,q and q located at r ,r , r , respectively.

Hence, no work is required to bring any charge to\npoint E.", "2.8 P E E F\nOTENTIAL NERGY IN AN XTERNAL IELD\n2.8.1 Potential energy of a single charge\nIn Section 2.7, the source of the electric field was specified – the charges\nand their locations - and the potential energy of the system of those charges\nwas determined. In this section, we ask a related but a distinct question. What is the potential energy of a charge q in a given field? This question\nwas, in fact, the starting point that led us to the notion of the electrostatic\npotential (Sections 2.1 and 2.2). But here we address this question again\nto clarify in what way it is different from the discussion in Section 2.7. The main difference is that we are now concerned with the potential\nenergy of a charge (or charges) in an external field. The external field E is\nnot produced by the given charge(s) whose potential energy we wish to\ncalculate. E is produced by sources external to the given charge(s).The\nexternal sources may be known, but often they are unknown or\nunspecified; what is specified is the electric field E or the electrostatic\npotential V due to the external sources. We assume that the charge q\ndoes not significantly affect the sources producing the external field. This\nis true if q is very small, or the external sources are held fixed by other\nunspecified forces. Even if q is finite, its influence on the external sources\nmay still be ignored in the situation when very strong sources far away\nat infinity produce a finite field E in the region of interest. Note again that\nwe are interested in determining the potential energy of a given charge q\n(and later, a system of charges) in the external field; we are not interested\nin the potential energy of the sources producing the external electric field. The external electric field E and the corresponding external potential\nV may vary from point to point. By definition, V at a point P is the work\n58\ndone in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to the point P. Reprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n(We continue to take potential at infinity to be zero.) Thus, work done in\nbringing a charge q from infinity to the point P in the external field is qV. This work is stored in the form of potential energy of q. If the point P has\nposition vector r relative to some origin, we can write:\nPotential energy of q at r in an external field\n= qV(r) (2.27)\nwhere V(r) is the external potential at the point r. Thus, if an electron with charge q = e = 1.6×10–19 C is accelerated by\na potential difference of DV = 1 volt, it would gain energy of qDV = 1.6 ×\n10–19J. This unit of energy is defined as 1 electron volt or 1eV, i.e.,\n1 eV=1.6 × 10–19J. The units based on eV are most commonly used in\natomic, nuclear and particle physics, (1 keV = 103eV = 1.6 × 10–16J, 1 MeV\n= 106eV = 1.6 × 10–13J, 1 GeV = 109eV = 1.6 × 10–10J and 1 TeV = 1012eV\n= 1.6 × 10–7J).", "[This has already been defined on Page 117, XI Physics\nPart I, Table 6.1.]\n2.8.2 Potential energy of a system of two charges in an\nexternal field\nNext, we ask: what is the potential energy of a system of two charges q\n1\nand q located at r and r , respectively, in an external field?

As seen in the last chapter, in a uniform electric field,\nthe dipole experiences no net force; but experiences a\ntorque ttttt given by\nttttt ===== p × E (2.30)\nwhich will tend to rotate it (unless p is parallel or\nantiparallel to E). Suppose an external torque ttttt is\next\napplied in such a manner that it just neutralises this\ntorque and rotates it in the plane of paper from angle q\n0\nto angle q at an infinitesimal angular speed and without\n1\nangular acceleration. The amount of work done by the\nexternal torque will be given by\nFIGURE 2.16 Potential energy of a\ndipole in a uniform external field.", "( )\n= pE cosq - cosq (2.31)\n0 1\nThis work is stored as the potential energy of the system. We can\nthen associate potential energy U(q) with an inclination q of the dipole. Similar to other potential energies, there is a freedom in choosing the\nangle where the potential energy U is taken to be zero. A natural choice\nis to take q = p / 2. (An explanation for it is provided towards the end of\n0\ndiscussion.) We can then write,\n(2.32)\n60\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\nThis expression can alternately be understood also from Eq. (2.29). We apply Eq. (2.29) to the present system of two charges +q and –q. The\npotential energy expression then reads\nU¢ (q)= q[V( r ) - V( r ) -] q2 (2.33)\n1 2 4p e· 2a\n0\nHere, r and r denote the position vectors of +q and –q. Now, the\n1 2\npotential difference between positions r and r equals the work done\n1 2\nin bringing a unit positive charge against field from r to r . The\n2 1\ndisplacement parallel to the force is 2a cosq. Thus, [V(r )–V (r )] =\n1 2\n–E × 2a cosq . We thus obtain,\nq2 q2\nU¢ (q)= - pEcosq- = - p.E-\n(2.34)\n4p e· 2a 4p e· 2a\n0 0\nWe note that U¢ (q) differs from U(q) by a quantity which is just a constant\nfor a given dipole. Since a constant is insignificant for potential energy, we\ncan drop the second term in Eq. (2.34) and it then reduces to Eq. (2.32). We can now understand why we took q=p/2. In this case, the work\n0\ndone against the external field E in bringing +q and – q are equal and\nopposite and cancel out, i.e., q [V (r ) – V (r )]=0. 1 2\nExample 2.6 A molecule of a substance has a permanent electric\ndipole moment of magnitude 10–29 C m. A mole of this substance is\npolarised (at low temperature) by applying a strong electrostatic field\nof magnitude 106 V m–1. The direction of the field is suddenly changed\nby an angle of 60º. Estimate the heat released by the substance in\naligning its dipoles along the new direction of the field. For simplicity,\nassume 100% polarisation of the sample. Solution Here, dipole moment of each molecules = 10–29 C m\nAs 1 mole of the substance contains 6 × 1023 molecules,\ntotal dipole moment of all the molecules, p = 6 × 1023 × 10–29 C m\n= 6 × 10–6C m\nEXAMPLE\nInitial potential energy, U = –pE cos q = –6×10–6×106 cos 0° = –6 J\ni\nFinal potential energy (when q = 60°), U = –6 × 10–6 × 106 cos 60° = –3 J\nf\nChange in potential energy = –3 J – (–6J) = 3 J\nSo, there is loss in potential energy. This must be the energy released\n2.6\nby the substance in the form of heat in aligning its dipoles. 2.9 E C\nLECTROSTATICS OF ONDUCTORS\nConductors and insulators were described briefly in Chapter 1. Conductors contain mobile charge carriers. In metallic conductors, these\ncharge carriers are electrons. In a metal, the outer (valence) electrons\npart away from their atoms and are free to move. These electrons are free\nwithin the metal but not free to leave the metal.", "The free electrons form a\nkind of ‘gas’; they collide with each other and with the ions, and move\nrandomly in different directions. In an external electric field, they drift\nagainst the direction of the field. The positive ions made up of the nuclei\nand the bound electrons remain held in their fixed positions. In electrolytic\n61\nconductors, the charge carriers are both positive and negative ions; but\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nthe situation in this case is more involved – the movement of the charge\ncarriers is affected both by the external electric field as also by the\nso-called chemical forces (see Chapter 3). We shall restrict our discussion\nto metallic solid conductors. Let us note important results regarding\nelectrostatics of conductors. 1. Inside a conductor, electrostatic field is zero\nConsider a conductor, neutral or charged. There may also be an external\nelectrostatic field. In the static situation, when there is no current inside\nor on the surface of the conductor, the electric field is zero everywhere\ninside the conductor. This fact can be taken as the defining property of a\nconductor. A conductor has free electrons. As long as electric field is not\nzero, the free charge carriers would experience force and drift. In the\nstatic situation, the free charges have so distributed themselves that the\nelectric field is zero everywhere inside. Electrostatic field is zero inside a\nconductor. 2. At the surface of a charged conductor, electrostatic field\nmust be normal to the surface at every point\nIf E were not normal to the surface, it would have some non-zero\ncomponent along the surface. Free charges on the surface of the conductor\nwould then experience force and move. In the static situation, therefore,\nE should have no tangential component. Thus electrostatic field at the\nsurface of a charged conductor must be normal to the surface at every\npoint. (For a conductor without any surface charge density, field is zero\neven at the surface.) See result 5. 3. The interior of a conductor can have no excess charge in\nthe static situation\nA neutral conductor has equal amounts of positive and negative charges\nin every small volume or surface element. When the conductor is charged,\nthe excess charge can reside only on the surface in the static situation. This follows from the Gauss’s law. Consider any arbitrary volume element\nv inside a conductor. On the closed surface S bounding the volume\nelement v, electrostatic field is zero. Thus the total electric flux through S\nis zero. Hence, by Gauss’s law, there is no net charge enclosed by S. But\nthe surface S can be made as small as you like, i.e., the volume v can be\nmade vanishingly small. This means there is no net charge at any point\ninside the conductor, and any excess charge must reside at the surface. 4. Electrostatic potential is constant throughout the volume\nof the conductor and has the same value (as inside) on\nits surface\nThis follows from results 1 and 2 above.", "Since E = 0 inside the conductor\nand has no tangential component on the surface, no work is done in\nmoving a small test charge within the conductor and on its surface. That\nis, there is no potential difference between any two points inside or on\n62\nthe surface of the conductor. Hence, the result. If the conductor is charged,\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\nelectric field normal to the surface exists; this means potential will be\ndifferent for the surface and a point just outside the surface. In a system of conductors of arbitrary size, shape and\ncharge configuration, each conductor is characterised by a constant\nvalue of potential, but this constant may differ from one conductor to\nthe other. 5. Electric field at the surface of a charged conductor\ns\nE = e nˆ (2.35)\n0\nwhere s is the surface charge density and nˆ is a unit vector normal\nto the surface in the outward direction. To derive the result, choose a pill box (a short cylinder) as the Gaussian\nsurface about any point P on the surface, as shown in Fig. 2.17. The pill\nbox is partly inside and partly outside the surface of the conductor. It\nhas a small area of cross section d S and negligible height. Just inside the surface, the electrostatic field is zero; just outside, the\nfield is normal to the surface with magnitude E. Thus,\nthe contribution to the total flux through the pill box\ncomes only from the outside (circular) cross-section\nof the pill box. This equals ± EdS (positive for s > 0,\nnegative for s < 0), since over the small area dS, E\nmay be considered constant and E and dS are parallel\nor antiparallel. The charge enclosed by the pill box\nis sdS. By Gauss’s law\nsd S\nEdS =\ne\n0\ns\nE = (2.36)\ne\n0\nIncluding the fact that electric field is normal to the FIGURE 2.17 The Gaussian surface\nsurface, we get the vector relation, Eq. (2.35), which (a pill box) chosen to derive Eq. (2.35)\nis true for both signs of s. For s > 0, electric field is for electric field at the surface of a\nnormal to the surface outward; for s < 0, electric field charged conductor. is normal to the surface inward. 6. Electrostatic shielding\nConsider a conductor with a cavity, with no charges inside the cavity. A\nremarkable result is that the electric field inside the cavity is zero, whatever\nbe the size and shape of the cavity and whatever be the charge on the\nconductor and the external fields in which it might be placed. We have\nproved a simple case of this result already: the electric field inside a charged\nspherical shell is zero. The proof of the result for the shell makes use of\nthe spherical symmetry of the shell (see Chapter 1). But the vanishing of\nelectric field in the (charge-free) cavity of a conductor is, as mentioned\n63\nabove, a very general result. A related result is that even if the conductor\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nis charged or charges are induced on a neutral\nconductor by an external field, all charges reside\nonly on the outer surface of a conductor with cavity.", "The proofs of the results noted in Fig. 2.18 are\nomitted here, but we note their important\nimplication. Whatever be the charge and field\nconfiguration outside, any cavity in a conductor\nremains shielded from outside electric influence: the\nfield inside the cavity is always zero. This is known\nas electrostatic shielding. The effect can be made\nuse of in protecting sensitive instruments from\nFIGURE 2.18 The electric field inside a\noutside electrical influence. Figure 2.19 gives a\ncavity of any conductor is zero. All\nsummary of the important electrostatic properties\ncharges reside only on the outer surface\nof a conductor. of a conductor with cavity. (There are no\ncharges placed in the cavity.)\nFIGURE 2.19 Some important electrostatic properties of a conductor. Example 2.7\n(a) A comb run through one’s dry hair attracts small bits of paper.

If the hair is wet, or if it is rainy day, friction\nbetween hair and the comb reduces. The comb does not get\ncharged and thus it will not attract small bits of paper. 64\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n(b) To enable them to conduct charge (produced by friction) to the EXAMPLE\nground; as too much of static electricity accumulated may result\nin spark and result in fire.

In contrast to conductors,\nthey have no (or negligible number of) charge carriers. Recall from Section\n2.9 what happens when a conductor is placed in an\nexternal electric field. The free charge carriers move\nand charge distribution in the conductor adjusts\nitself in such a way that the electric field due to\ninduced charges opposes the external field within\nthe conductor. This happens until, in the static\nsituation, the two fields cancel each other and the\nnet electrostatic field in the conductor is zero. In a\ndielectric, this free movement of charges is not\npossible. It turns out that the external field induces\ndipole moment by stretching or re-orienting\nmolecules of the dielectric.", "The collective effect of all\nthe molecular dipole moments is net charges on the\nFIGURE 2.20 Difference in behaviour\nsurface of the dielectric which produce a field that\nof a conductor and a dielectric\nopposes the external field. Unlike in a conductor,\nin an external electric field. however, the opposing field so induced does not\nexactly cancel the external field. It only reduces it. The extent of the effect depends on the\nnature of the dielectric. To understand the\neffect, we need to look at the charge\ndistribution of a dielectric at the\nmolecular level. The molecules of a substance may be\npolar or non-polar. In a non-polar\nmolecule, the centres of positive and\nnegative charges coincide. The molecule\nthen has no permanent (or intrinsic) dipole\nmoment. Examples of non-polar molecules\nare oxygen (O ) and hydrogen (H )\n2 2\nmolecules which, because of their\nsymmetry, have no dipole moment. On the\nother hand, a polar molecule is one in which\nthe centres of positive and negative charges\nare separated (even when there is no\nFIGURE 2.21 Some examples of polar\nexternal field). Such molecules have a\nand non-polar molecules. permanent dipole moment. An ionic\nmolecule such as HCl or a molecule of water\n(H O) are examples of polar molecules. 65\n2\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nIn an external electric field, the\npositive and negative charges of a non-\npolar molecule are displaced in opposite\ndirections. The displacement stops when\nthe external force on the constituent\ncharges of the molecule is balanced by\nthe restoring force (due to internal fields\nin the molecule). The non-polar molecule\nthus develops an induced dipole moment. The dielectric is said to be polarised by\nthe external field. We consider only the\nsimple situation when the induced dipole\nmoment is in the direction of the field and\nis proportional to the field strength. (Substances for which this assumption\nis true are called linear isotropic\ndielectrics.) The induced dipole moments\nof different molecules add up giving a net\ndipole moment of the dielectric in the\npresence of the external field. A dielectric with polar molecules also\ndevelops a net dipole moment in an\nexternal field, but for a different reason. FIGURE 2.22 A dielectric develops a net dipole In the absence of any external field, the\nmoment in an external electric field. (a) Non-polar\ndifferent permanent dipoles are oriented\nmolecules, (b) Polar molecules. randomly due to thermal agitation; so\nthe total dipole moment is zero. When\nan external field is applied, the individual dipole moments tend to align\nwith the field. When summed overall the molecules, there is then a net\ndipole moment in the direction of the external field, i.e., the dielectric is\npolarised. The extent of polarisation depends on the relative strength of\ntwo mutually opposite factors: the dipole potential energy in the external\nfield tending to align the dipoles with the field and thermal energy tending\nto disrupt the alignment.", "There may be, in addition, the ‘induced dipole\nmoment’ effect as for non-polar molecules, but generally the alignment\neffect is more important for polar molecules. Thus in either case, whether polar or non-polar, a dielectric develops\na net dipole moment in the presence of an external field. The dipole\nmoment per unit volume is called polarisation and is denoted by P. For\nlinear isotropic dielectrics,\nP =ec E (2.37)\n0 e\nwhere c is a constant characteristic of the dielectric and is known as the\ne\nelectric susceptibility of the dielectric medium. It is possible to relate c to the molecular properties of the substance,\ne\nbut we shall not pursue that here. The question is: how does the polarised dielectric modify the original\nexternal field inside it? Let us consider, for simplicity, a rectangular\ndielectric slab placed in a uniform external field E parallel to two of its\n66 0\nfaces. The field causes a uniform polarisation P of the dielectric. Thus\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\nevery volume element Dv of the slab has a dipole moment\nP Dv in the direction of the field. The volume element Dv is\nmacroscopically small but contains a very large number of\nmolecular dipoles. Anywhere inside the dielectric, the\nvolume element Dv has no net charge (though it has net\ndipole moment). This is, because, the positive charge of one\ndipole sits close to the negative charge of the adjacent dipole. However, at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the\nelectric field, there is evidently a net charge density. As seen\nin Fig 2.23, the positive ends of the dipoles remain\nunneutralised at the right surface and the negative ends at\nthe left surface. The unbalanced charges are the induced\ncharges due to the external field. Thus, the polarised dielectric is equivalent to two charged\nsurfaces with induced surface charge densities, say s\np\nand –s.

The conductors have charges, say Q and Q , and potentials\n1 2\nV and V . Usually, in practice, the two conductors have charges Q\n1 2\nand – Q, with potential difference V = V – V between them. We shall\n1 2\nconsider only this kind of charge configuration of the capacitor. (Even a\nsingle conductor can be used as a capacitor by assuming the other at\ninfinity.) The conductors may be so charged by connecting them to the\ntwo terminals of a battery. Q is called the charge of the capacitor, though\nthis, in fact, is the charge on one of the conductors – the total charge of\nthe capacitor is zero.", "The electric field in the region between the\nconductors is proportional to the charge Q. That\nis, if the charge on the capacitor is, say doubled,\nthe electric field will also be doubled at every point. (This follows from the direct proportionality\nbetween field and charge implied by Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle.) Now,\npotential difference V is the work done per unit\npositive charge in taking a small test charge from\nthe conductor 2 to 1 against the field. FIGURE 2.24 A system of two conductors\nConsequently, V is also proportional to Q, and the separated by an insulator forms a capacitor. ratio Q/V is a constant:\nQ\nC = (2.38)\nV\nThe constant C is called the capacitance of the capacitor. C is independent\n67\nof Q or V, as stated above. The capacitance C depends only on the\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\ngeometrical configuration (shape, size, separation) of the system of two\nconductors. [As we shall see later, it also depends on the nature of the\ninsulator (dielectric) separating the two conductors.] The SI unit of\ncapacitance is 1 farad (=1 coulomb volt-1) or 1 F = 1 C V–1. A capacitor\nwith fixed capacitance is symbolically shown as ---||---, while the one with\nvariable capacitance is shown as . Equation (2.38) shows that for large C, V is small for a given Q. This\nmeans a capacitor with large capacitance can hold large amount of charge\nQ at a relatively small V. This is of practical importance. High potential\ndifference implies strong electric field around the conductors. A strong\nelectric field can ionise the surrounding air and accelerate the charges so\nproduced to the oppositely charged plates, thereby neutralising the charge\non the capacitor plates, at least partly. In other words, the charge of the\ncapacitor leaks away due to the reduction in insulating power of the\nintervening medium. The maximum electric field that a dielectric medium can withstand\nwithout break-down (of its insulating property) is called its dielectric\nstrength; for air it is about 3 × 106 Vm–1. For a separation between\nconductors of the order of 1 cm or so, this field corresponds to a potential\ndifference of 3 × 104 V between the conductors. Thus, for a capacitor to\nstore a large amount of charge without leaking, its capacitance should\nbe high enough so that the potential difference and hence the electric\nfield do not exceed the break-down limits. Put differently, there is a limit\nto the amount of charge that can be stored on a given capacitor without\nsignificant leaking. In practice, a farad is a very big unit; the most common\nunits are its sub-multiples 1 mF = 10–6 F, 1 nF = 10–9 F, 1 pF = 10–12 F,\netc. Besides its use in storing charge, a capacitor is a key element of most\nac circuits with important functions, as described in Chapter 7. 2.12 T P P C\nHE ARALLEL LATE APACITOR\nA parallel plate capacitor consists of two large plane parallel conducting\nplates separated by a small distance (Fig. 2.25).", "We first take the\nintervening medium between the plates to be\nvacuum. The effect of a dielectric medium between\nthe plates is discussed in the next section. Let A be\nthe area of each plate and d the separation between\nthem. The two plates have charges Q and –Q. Since\nd is much smaller than the linear dimension of the\nplates (d2 << A), we can use the result on electric\nfield by an infinite plane sheet of uniform surface\ncharge density (Section 1.15). Plate 1 has surface\ncharge density s = Q/A and plate 2 has a surface\ncharge density –s. Using Eq. (1.33), the electric field\nin different regions is:\nOuter region I (region above the plate 1),\nFIGURE 2.25 The parallel plate capacitor. s s\n68 E = 2e - 2e = 0 (2.39)\n0 0\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\nOuter region II (region below the plate 2),\ns s\nE = 2e - 2e = 0 (2.40)\n0 0\nIn the inner region between the plates 1 and 2, the electric fields due\nto the two charged plates add up, giving\ns s s Q\nE = 2e + 2e = e e= A (2.41)\n0 0 0 0\nThe direction of electric field is from the positive to the negative plate. Thus, the electric field is localised between the two plates and is\nuniform throughout. For plates with finite area, this will not be true near\nthe outer boundaries of the plates. The field lines bend outward at the\nedges — an effect called ‘fringing of the field’. By the same token, s will\nhttp://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/java/capacitance/ Interactive Factors\nnot be strictly uniform on the entire plate. [E and s are related by Eq. (2.35).] However, for d2 << A, these effects can be ignored in the regions\nsufficiently far from the edges, and the field there is given by Eq. (2.41). affecting\nNow for uniform electric field, potential difference is simply the electric\nJava\nfield times the distance between the plates, that is,\nV = Ed = e 1 Qd A (2.42) tutorial capacitance,\n0\nThe capacitance C of the parallel plate capacitor is then\nQ e A\nC = = = 0 (2.43)\nV d capacitors\nwhich, as expected, depends only on the geometry of the system.

Another way of seeing the ‘bigness’ of 1F is to calculate the area of the\nplates needed to have C = 1F for a separation of, say 1 cm:\nA = C ed = 8.851 F 10· -1 120 C- 2 2m =109m2 (2.45)\n· N–1m–2\n0\nwhich is a plate about 30 km in length and breadth! 2.13 E D C\nFFECT OF IELECTRIC ON APACITANCE\nWith the understanding of the behaviour of dielectrics in an external\nfield developed in Section 2.10, let us see how the capacitance of a parallel\nplate capacitor is modified when a dielectric is present. As before, we\nhave two large plates, each of area A, separated by a distance d. The\ncharge on the plates is ±Q, corresponding to the charge density ±s (with\ns = Q/A).", "When there is vacuum between the plates,\ns\nE =\n0 e 69\n0\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nand the potential difference V is\n0\nV = E d\n0 0\nThe capacitance C in this case is\n0\nQ A\nC 0 = V =e 0 d (2.46)\n0\nConsider next a dielectric inserted between the plates fully occupying\nthe intervening region. The dielectric is polarised by the field and, as\nexplained in Section 2.10, the effect is equivalent to two charged sheets\n(at the surfaces of the dielectric normal to the field) with surface charge\ndensities s and –s. The electric field in the dielectric then corresponds\np p\nto the case when the net surface charge density on the plates is ±(s – s ). p\nThat is,\ns -s\nE = e P (2.47)\n0\nso that the potential difference across the plates is\ns -s\nV = Ed = e P d (2.48)\n0\nFor linear dielectrics, we expect s to be proportional to E , i.e., to s. p 0\nThus, (s – s )is proportional to s and we can write\np\ns\ns -s =\n(2.49)\nP K\nwhere K is a constant characteristic of the dielectric. Clearly, K > 1. We\nthen have\ns d Qd\nV = e K = Ae K (2.50)\n0 0\nThe capacitance C, with dielectric between the plates, is then\nQ e KA\nC = = 0 (2.51)\nV d\nThe product eK is called the permittivity of the medium and is\n0\ndenoted by e\ne = e K (2.52)\n0\nFor vacuum K = 1 and e = e; e is called the permittivity of the vacuum. 0 0\nThe dimensionless ratio\ne\nK = e (2.53)\n0\nis called the dielectric constant of the substance. As remarked before,\nfrom Eq. (2.49), it is clear that K is greater than 1. From Eqs. (2.46) and\n(2. 51)\nC\nK = (2.54)\nC\n0\nThus, the dielectric constant of a substance is the factor (>1) by which\nthe capacitance increases from its vacuum value, when the dielectric is\n70\ninserted fully between the plates of a capacitor. Though we arrived at\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\nEq. (2.54) for the case of a parallel plate capacitor, it holds good for any\ntype of capacitor and can, in fact, be viewed in general as a definition of\nthe dielectric constant of a substance. Example 2.8 A slab of material of dielectric constant K has the same\narea as the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor but has a thickness\n(3/4)d, where d is the separation of the plates. How is the capacitance\nchanged when the slab is inserted between the plates? Solution Let E = V /d be the electric field between the plates when\n0 0\nthere is no dielectric and the potential difference is V .

To determine the energy stored in this configuration,\nconsider initially two uncharged conductors 1 and 2. Imagine next a\nprocess of transferring charge from conductor 2 to conductor 1 bit by\n73\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nbit, so that at the end, conductor 1 gets charge Q. By\ncharge conservation, conductor 2 has charge –Q at\nthe end (Fig 2.30 ). In transferring positive charge from conductor 2\nto conductor 1, work will be done externally, since at\nany stage conductor 1 is at a higher potential than\nconductor 2. To calculate the total work done, we first\ncalculate the work done in a small step involving\ntransfer of an infinitesimal (i.e., vanishingly small)\namount of charge.

When the capacitor\ndischarges, this stored-up energy is released.", "It is possible to view the\npotential energy of the capacitor as ‘stored’ in the electric field between\nthe plates.

Electrostatic force is a conservative force. Work done by an external\nforce (equal and opposite to the electrostatic force) in bringing a charge\nq from a point R to a point P is q(V –V ), which is the difference in\nP R\npotential energy of charge q between the final and initial points. 2. Potential at a point is the work done per unit charge (by an external\nagency) in bringing a charge from infinity to that point. Potential at a\npoint is arbitrary to within an additive constant, since it is the potential\ndifference between two points which is physically significant.", "If potential\nat infinity is chosen to be zero; potential at a point with position vector\nr due to a point charge Q placed at the origin is given is given by\n1 Q\nV(r)=\n4p e r\no\n3.

An equipotential surface is a surface over which potential has a constant\nvalue. For a point charge, concentric spheres centred at a location of the\ncharge are equipotential surfaces. The electric field E at a point is\nperpendicular to the equipotential surface through the point. E is in the\ndirection of the steepest decrease of potential. 76\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n6. Potential energy stored in a system of charges is the work done (by an\nexternal agency) in assembling the charges at their locations. Potential\nenergy of two charges q , q at r , r is given by\n1 2 1 2\n1 q q\nU = 1 2\n4p e r\n0 12\nwhere r is distance between q and q . 12 1 2\n7. The potential energy of a charge q in an external potential V(r) is qV(r). The potential energy of a dipole moment p in a uniform electric field E\nis –p.E. 8. Electrostatics field E is zero in the interior of a conductor; just outside\nthe surface of a charged conductor, E is normal to the surface given by\ns\nE = e nˆ where nˆ is the unit vector along the outward normal to the\n0\nsurface and s is the surface charge density. Charges in a conductor can\nreside only at its surface. Potential is constant within and on the surface\nof a conductor. In a cavity within a conductor (with no charges), the\nelectric field is zero. 9. A capacitor is a system of two conductors separated by an insulator. Its\ncapacitance is defined by C = Q/V, where Q and –Q are the charges on the\ntwo conductors and V is the potential difference between them. C is\ndetermined purely geometrically, by the shapes, sizes and relative\npositions of the two conductors. The unit of capacitance is farad:,\n1 F = 1 C V–1. For a parallel plate capacitor (with vacuum between the\nplates),\nA\ne\nC =\n0 d\nwhere A is the area of each plate and d the separation between them. 10. If the medium between the plates of a capacitor is filled with an insulating\nsubstance (dielectric), the electric field due to the charged plates induces\na net dipole moment in the dielectric. This effect, called polarisation,\ngives rise to a field in the opposite direction. The net electric field inside\nthe dielectric and hence the potential difference between the plates is\nthus reduced.", "Consequently, the capacitance C increases from its value\nC when there is no medium (vacuum),\n0\nC = KC\n0\nwhere K is the dielectric constant of the insulating substance. 11.

Electrostatics deals with forces between charges at rest. But if there is a\nforce on a charge, how can it be at rest? Thus, when we are talking of\nelectrostatic force between charges, it should be understood that each\ncharge is being kept at rest by some unspecified force that opposes the\nnet Coulomb force on the charge. 2. A capacitor is so configured that it confines the electric field lines within\na small region of space. Thus, even though field may have considerable\nstrength, the potential difference between the two conductors of a\ncapacitor is small. 3. Electric field is discontinuous across the surface of a spherical charged\nσ\nshell. It is zero inside and ε nˆ outside. Electric potential is, however\n0\ncontinuous across the surface, equal to q/4peR at the surface. 0\n4. The torque p × E on a dipole causes it to oscillate about E. Only if there\nis a dissipative mechanism, the oscillations are damped and the dipole\neventually aligns with E. 5. Potential due to a charge q at its own location is not defined – it is\ninfinite. 6. In the expression qV(r) for potential energy of a charge q, V(r) is the\npotential due to external charges and not the potential due to q. As seen\nin point 5, this expression will be ill-defined if V(r) includes potential\n78 due to a charge q itself. Reprint 2025-26\nElectrostatic Potential\nand Capacitance\n7.
