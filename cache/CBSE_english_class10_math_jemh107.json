["COORDINATE GEOMETRY 99\n7\nC G\nOORDINATE EOMETRY\n7.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you have studied that to locate the position of a point on a plane, we\nrequire a pair of coordinate axes. The distance of a point from the y-axis is called its\nx-coordinate, or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is called its\ny-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis are of the form\n(x, 0), and of a point on the y-axis are of the form (0, y). Here is a play for you. Draw a set of a pair of perpendicular axes on a graph\npaper. Now plot the following points and join them as directed: Join the point A(4, 8) to\nB(3, 9) to C(3, 8) to D(1, 6) to E(1, 5) to F(3, 3) to G(6, 3) to H(8, 5) to I(8, 6) to\nJ(6, 8) to K(6, 9) to L(5, 8) to A. Then join the points P(3.5, 7), Q (3, 6) and R(4, 6) to\nform a triangle. Also join the points X(5.5, 7), Y(5, 6) and Z(6, 6) to form a triangle. Now join S(4, 5), T(4.5, 4) and U(5, 5) to form a triangle. Lastly join S to the points\n(0, 5) and (0, 6) and join U to the points (9, 5) and (9, 6). What picture have you got? Also, you have seen that a linear equation in two variables of the form\nax + by + c = 0, (a, b are not simultaneously zero), when represented graphically,\ngives a straight line. Further, in Chapter 2, you have seen the graph of\ny = ax2 + bx + c (a „ 0), is a parabola. In fact, coordinate geometry has been developed\nas an algebraic tool for studying geometry of figures. It helps us to study geometry\nusing algebra, and understand algebra with the help of geometry. Because of this,\ncoordinate geometry is widely applied in various fields such as physics, engineering,\nnavigation, seismology and art! In this chapter, you will learn how to find the distance between the two points\nwhose coordinates are given. You will also study how to find the coordinates of the\npoint which divides a line segment joining two given points in a given ratio. Reprint 2025-26\n100 MATHEMATICS\n7.2 Distance Formula\nLet us consider the following situation:\nA town B is located 36 km east and 15\nkm north of the town A. How would you find\nthe distance from town A to town B without\nactually measuring it. Let us see. This situation\ncan be represented graphically as shown in\nFig. 7.1. You may use the Pythagoras Theorem\nto calculate this distance. Fig. 7.1\nNow, suppose two points lie on the x-axis. Can we find the distance between them? For\ninstance, consider two points A(4, 0) and B(6, 0)\nin Fig. 7.2. The points A and B lie on the x-axis. From the figure you can see that OA = 4\nunits and OB = 6 units. Therefore, the distance of B from A, i.e.,\nAB = OB – OA = 6 – 4 = 2 units. So, if two points lie on the x-axis, we can\neasily find the distance between them. Now, suppose we take two points lying on\nthe y-axis. Can you find the distance between\nthem. If the points C(0, 3) and D(0, 8) lie on the\ny-axis, similarly we find that CD = 8 – 3 = 5 units\nFig. 7.2\n(see Fig. 7.2). Next, can you find the distance of A from C (in Fig. 7.2)?", "Since OA = 4 units and\nOC = 3 units, the distance of A from C, i.e., AC = 32 42 = 5 units. Similarly, you can\nfind the distance of B from D = BD = 10 units. Now, if we consider two points not lying on coordinate axis, can we find the\ndistance between them? Yes! We shall use Pythagoras theorem to do so. Let us see\nan example. In Fig. 7.3, the points P(4, 6) and Q(6, 8) lie in the first quadrant. How do we use\nPythagoras theorem to find the distance between them? Let us draw PR and QS\nperpendicular to the x-axis from P and Q respectively. Also, draw a perpendicular\nfrom P on QS to meet QS at T. Then the coordinates of R and S are (4, 0) and (6, 0),\nrespectively. So, RS = 2 units. Also, QS = 8 units and TS = PR = 6 units. Reprint 2025-26\nCOORDINATE GEOMETRY 101\nTherefore, QT = 2 units and PT = RS = 2 units. Now, using the Pythagoras theorem, we\nhave\nPQ2 = PT2 + QT2\n= 22 + 22 = 8\nSo, PQ = 2 2 units\nHow will we find the distance between two\npoints in two different quadrants? Consider the points P(6, 4) and Q(–5, –3)\n(see Fig. 7.4). Draw QS perpendicular to the\nx-axis. Also draw a perpendicular PT from the\nFig. 7.3\npoint P on QS (extended) to meet y-axis at the\npoint R. Fig. 7.4\nThen PT = 11 units and QT = 7 units. (Why?)\nUsing the Pythagoras Theorem to the right triangle PTQ, we get\nPQ = 112 72 = 170 units. Reprint 2025-26\n102 MATHEMATICS\nLet us now find the distance between any two\npoints P(x , y ) and Q(x , y ). Draw PR and QS\n1 1 2 2\nperpendicular to the x-axis. A perpendicular from the\npoint P on QS is drawn to meet it at the point\nT (see Fig. 7.5). Then, OR = x , OS = x . So, RS = x – x = PT. 1 2 2 1\nAlso, SQ = y , ST = PR = y . So, QT = y – y . 2 1 2 1\nNow, applying the Pythagoras theorem in  PTQ, we get\nPQ2 = PT2 + QT2\nFig. 7.5\n= (x – x )2 + (y – y )2\n2 1 2 1\nTherefore, PQ = x  x 2  y  y 2\n2 1 2 1\nNote that since distance is always non-negative, we take only the positive square\nroot. So, the distance between the points P(x , y ) and Q(x , y ) is\n1 1 2 2\nPQ = x – x 2 +y – y 2 ,\n2 1 2 1\nwhich is called the distance formula. Remarks :\n1. In particular, the distance of a point P(x, y) from the origin O(0, 0) is given by\nOP = x2y2 . 2. We can also write, PQ = x  x 2  y  y 2 . (Why?)\n1 2 1 2\nExample 1 : Do the points (3, 2), (–2, –3) and (2, 3) form a triangle? If so, name the\ntype of triangle formed. Solution : Let us apply the distance formula to find the distances PQ, QR and PR,\nwhere P(3, 2), Q(–2, –3) and R(2, 3) are the given points. We have\nPQ = (32)2  (2  3)2  52  52  50 = 7.07 (approx.)\nQR = (–2 –2)2  (–3 –3)2  (–4)2  (–6)2  52 = 7.21 (approx.)\nPR = (3 – 2)2  (2 – 3)2  12  (1)2  2 = 1.41 (approx.)\nSince the sum of any two of these distances is greater than the third distance, therefore,\nthe points P, Q and R form a triangle. Reprint 2025-26\nCOORDINATE GEOMETRY 103\nAlso, PQ2 + PR2 = QR2, by the converse of Pythagoras theorem, we have  P = 90°. Therefore, PQR is a right triangle.", "Example 2 : Show that the points (1, 7), (4, 2), (–1, –1) and (– 4, 4) are the vertices\nof a square. Solution : Let A(1, 7), B(4, 2), C(–1, –1) and D(– 4, 4) be the given points. One way\nof showing that ABCD is a square is to use the property that all its sides should be\nequal and both its digonals should also be equal. Now,\nAB = (1– 4)2 (7  2)2  9 25  34\nBC = (41)2 (2 1)2  25 9  34\nCD = (–14)2  (–1– 4)2  9  25  34\nDA = (14)2  (7 – 4)2  25  9  34\nAC = (11)2 (7 1)2  4  64  68\nBD = (4 4)2  (2  4)2  64  4  68\nSince, AB = BC = CD = DA and AC = BD, all the four sides of the quadrilateral\nABCD are equal and its diagonals AC and BD are also equal. Thereore, ABCD is a\nsquare. Alternative Solution : We find\nthe four sides and one diagonal, say,\nAC as above. Here AD2 + DC2 =\n34 + 34 = 68 = AC2. Therefore, by\nthe converse of Pythagoras\ntheorem,  D = 90°. A quadrilateral\nwith all four sides equal and one\nangle 90° is a square. So, ABCD\nis a square.

Give reasons for your\nFig. 7.6\nanswer. Reprint 2025-26\n104 MATHEMATICS\nSolution : Using the distance formula, we have\nAB = (63)2  (41)2  9 9  18 3 2\nBC = (8 – 6)2  (6 – 4)2  4  4  8  2 2\nAC = (8 – 3)2  (6 –1)2  25 25  50 5 2\nSince, AB + BC = 3 2  2 2 5 2  AC, we can say that the points A, B and C\nare collinear. Therefore, they are seated in a line. Example 4 : Find a relation between x and y such that the point (x , y) is equidistant\nfrom the points (7, 1) and (3, 5). Solution : Let P(x, y) be equidistant from the points A(7, 1) and B(3, 5). We are given that AP = BP. So, AP2 = BP2\ni.e., (x – 7)2 + (y – 1)2 = (x – 3)2 + (y – 5)2\ni.e., x2 – 14x + 49 + y2 – 2y + 1 = x2 – 6x + 9 + y2 – 10y + 25\ni.e., x – y = 2\nwhich is the required relation. Remark : Note that the graph of the equation\nx – y = 2 is a line. From your earlier studies,\nyou know that a point which is equidistant\nfrom A and B lies on the perpendicular\nbisector of AB. Therefore, the graph of\nx – y = 2 is the perpendicular bisector of AB\n(see Fig. 7.7). Example 5 : Find a point on the y-axis which\nis equidistant from the points A(6, 5) and\nB(– 4, 3). Solution : We know that a point on the\ny-axis is of the form (0, y). So, let the point\nFig. 7.7\nP(0, y) be equidistant from A and B. Then\n(6 – 0)2 + (5 – y)2 = (– 4 – 0)2 + (3 – y)2\ni.e., 36 + 25 + y2 – 10y = 16 + 9 + y2 – 6y\ni.e., 4y = 36\ni.e., y = 9\nReprint 2025-26\nCOORDINATE GEOMETRY 105\nSo, the required point is (0, 9).

Suppose a telephone company wants to\nposition a relay tower at P between A and B\nis such a way that the distance of the tower\nfrom B is twice its distance from A. If P lies\non AB, it will divide AB in the ratio 1 : 2\n(see Fig. 7.9). If we take A as the origin O,\nand 1 km as one unit on both the axis, the\ncoordinates of B will be (36, 15). In order to\nFig. 7.9\nknow the position of the tower, we must know\nthe coordinates of P. How do we find these\ncoordinates? Let the coordinates of P be (x, y). Draw perpendiculars from P and B to the\nx-axis, meeting it in D and E, respectively. Draw PC perpendicular to BE.
