["13\nCHAPTER\nOur Environment\nWe have heard the word ‘environment’ often being used on the\ntelevision, in newspapers and by people around us. Our elders tell\nus that the ‘environment’ is not what it used to be earlier; others say that\nwe should work in a healthy ‘environment’; and global summits involving\nthe developed and developing countries are regularly held to discuss\n‘environmental’ issues. In this chapter, we shall be studying how various\ncomponents in the environment interact with each other and how we\nimpact the environment. 1111133333.....11111 EEEEECCCCCOOOOO-----SSSSSYYYYYSSSSSTTTTTEEEEEMMMMM ————— WWWWWHHHHHAAAAATTTTT AAAAARRRRREEEEE IIIIITTTTTSSSSS CCCCCOOOOOMMMMMPPPPPOOOOONNNNNEEEEENNNNNTTTTTSSSSS????? All organisms such as plants, animals, microorganisms and human\nbeings as well as the physical surroundings interact with each other\nand maintain a balance in nature. All the interacting organisms in an\narea together with the non-living constituents of the environment form\nan ecosystem. Thus, an ecosystem consists of biotic components\ncomprising living organisms and abiotic components comprising\nphysical factors like temperature, rainfall, wind, soil and minerals. For example, if you visit a garden you will find different plants, such\nas grasses, trees; flower bearing plants like rose, jasmine, sunflower;\nand animals like frogs, insects and birds. All these living organisms\ninteract with each other and their growth, reproduction and other\nactivities are affected by the abiotic components of ecosystem. So a garden\nis an ecosystem. Other types of ecosystems are forests, ponds and lakes. These are natural ecosystems while gardens and crop-fields are human-\nmade (artificial) ecosystems. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....11111\nn You might have seen an aquarium. Let us try to design one. n What are the things that we need to keep in mind when we create\nan aquarium? The fish would need a free space for swimming (it\ncould be a large jar), water, oxygen and food. n We can provide oxygen through an oxygen pump (aerator) and\nfish food which is available in the market. 208 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nn If we add a few aquatic plants and animals it can become a self-\nsustaining system. Can you think how this happens? An aquarium\nis an example of a human-made ecosystem. n Can we leave the aquarium as such after we set it up? Why does\nit have to be cleaned once in a while? Do we have to clean ponds\nor lakes in the same manner? Why or why not? We have seen in earlier classes that organisms can be grouped as\nproducers, consumers and decomposers according to the manner in\nwhich they obtain their sustenance from the environment. Let us recall\nwhat we have learnt through the self sustaining ecosystem created by\nus above. Which organisms can make organic compounds like sugar\nand starch from inorganic substances using the radiant energy of the\nSun in the presence of chlorophyll?", "All green plants and certain bacteria\nwhich can produce food by photosynthesis come under this category\nand are called the producers. Organisms depend on the producers either directly or indirectly for\ntheir sustenance? These organisms which consume the food produced,\neither directly from producers or indirectly by feeding on other consumers\nare the consumers. Consumers can be classed variously as herbivores,\ncarnivores, omnivores and parasites. Can you give examples for each of\nthese categories of consumers? n Imagine the situation where you do not clean the aquarium and\nsome fish and plants have died. Have you ever thought what\nhappens when an organism dies? The microorganisms, comprising\nbacteria and fungi, break-down the dead remains and waste\nproducts of organisms. These microorganisms are the decomposers\nas they break-down the complex organic substances into simple\ninorganic substances that go into the soil and are used up once\nmore by the plants. What will happen to the garbage, and dead\nanimals and plants in their absence? Will the natural replenishment\nof the soil take place, even if decomposers are not there? AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....22222\nn While creating an aquarium did you take care not to put an aquatic\nanimal which would eat others? What would have happened\notherwise? n Make groups and discuss how each of the above groups of\norganisms are dependent on each other. n Write the aquatic organisms in order of who eats whom and form\na chain of at least three steps. → →\nn Would you consider any one group of organisms to be of primary\nimportance? Why or why not? Our Environment 209\nReprint 2025-26\n13.1.1 Food Chains and Webs\nIn Activity 13.4 we have formed a series of organisms feeding\non one another. This series or organisms taking part at\nvarious biotic levels form a food chain (Fig. 13.1). Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level. The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level. They fix up the solar energy and make it available for\nheterotrophs or the consumers. The herbivores or the primary\nconsumers come at the second, small carnivores or the\nsecondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or\nthe tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level (Fig. 13.2). We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us\nenergy to do work. Thus the interactions among various\ncomponents of the environment involves flow of energy from\none component of the system to another. As we have studied,\nthe autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and\nconvert it into chemical energy. This energy supports all the\nactivities of the living world. From autotrophs, the energy goes\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111133333.....11111\nto the heterotrophs and decomposers.", "However, as we saw in\nFood chain in nature\nthe previous Chapter on ‘Sources of Energy’, when one form\n(a) in forest, (b) in\nof energy is changed to another, some energy is lost to the\ngrassland and (c) in a\npond environment in forms which cannot be used again. The flow\nof energy between various components of the environment\nhas been extensively studied and it has been found that –\nn The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about\n1% of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it\ninto food energy. n When green plants are eaten by primary consumers, a great deal\nof energy is lost as heat to the environment, some amount goes\ninto digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth\nand reproduction. An average of 10% of the food eaten is turned\ninto its own body and made available for the next level of\nconsumers. n Therefore, 10% can be taken as the average value for the amount\nof organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next\nlevel of consumers. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111133333.....22222 n Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers,\nTrophic levels food chains generally consist of only three or four steps. The loss\nof energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy\nremains after four trophic levels. n There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower\ntrophic levels of an ecosystem, the greatest number is of the\nproducers. n The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly. Each organism\nis generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in\nturn are eaten by several other organisms. So instead of a straight\nline food chain, the relationship can be shown as a series of branching\nlines called a food web (Fig. 13.3). 210 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nFrom the energy flow diagram (Fig. 13.4),\ntwo things become clear. Firstly, the flow of\nenergy is unidirectional. The energy that is\ncaptured by the autotrophs does not revert\nback to the solar input and the energy which\npasses to the herbivores does not come back\nto autotrophs. As it moves progressively\nthrough the various trophic levels it is no\nlonger available to the previous level. Secondly, the energy available at each trophic\nlevel gets diminished progressively due to loss\nof energy at each level. Another interesting aspect of food chain\nis how unknowingly some harmful\nchemicals enter our bodies through the food\nchain. You have read in Class IX how water\ngets polluted. One of the reasons is the use of\nseveral pesticides and other chemicals to\nprotect our crops from diseases and pests. These chemicals are either washed down into\nthe soil or into the water bodies.", "From the\nsoil, these are absorbed by the plants along\nwith water and minerals, and from the water\nbodies these are taken up by aquatic plants\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111133333.....33333\nFood web, consisting of\nmany food chains\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111133333.....44444 Diagram showing flow of energy in an ecosystem\nOur Environment 211\nReprint 2025-26\nand animals. This is one of the ways in which they enter the food chain. As these chemicals are not degradable, these get accumulated\nprogressively at each trophic level. As human beings occupy the top\nlevel in any food chain, the maximum concentration of these chemicals\nget accumulated in our bodies. This phenomenon is known as biological\nmagnification. This is the reason why our food grains such as wheat\nand rice, vegetables and fruits, and even meat, contain varying amounts\nof pesticide residues. They cannot always be removed by washing or\nother means. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....33333\nn Newspaper reports about pesticide levels in ready-made food items\nare often seen these days and some states have banned these\nproducts. Debate in groups the need for such bans. n What do you think would be the source of pesticides in these food\nitems? Could pesticides get into our bodies from this source through\nother food products too? n Discuss what methods could be applied to reduce our intake of\npesticides. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. What are trophic levels? Give an example of a food chain and state the\ndifferent trophic levels in it. 2. What is the role of decomposers in the ecosystem? 1111133333.....22222 HHHHHOOOOOWWWWW DDDDDOOOOO OOOOOUUUUURRRRR AAAAACCCCCTTTTTIIIIIVVVVVIIIIITTTTTIIIIIEEEEESSSSS AAAAAFFFFFFFFFFEEEEECCCCCTTTTT TTTTTHHHHHEEEEE\nEEEEENNNNNVVVVVIIIIIRRRRROOOOONNNNNMMMMMEEEEENNNNNTTTTT????? We are an integral part of the environment. Changes in the environment\naffect us and our activities change the environment around us. We have\nalready seen in Class IX how our activities pollute the environment. In\nthis chapter, we shall be looking at two of the environmental problems\nin detail, that is, depletion of the ozone layer and waste disposal. 13.2.1 Ozone Layer and How it is Getting Depleted\nOzone (O ) is a molecule formed by three atoms of oxygen. While O ,\n3 2\nwhich we normally refer to as oxygen, is essential for all aerobic forms of\nlife. Ozone, is a deadly poison. However, at the higher levels of the\natmosphere, ozone performs an essential function. It shields the surface\nof the earth from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. This radiation\n212 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nis highly damaging to organisms, for example, it is known to cause skin\ncancer in human beings. Ozone at the higher levels of the atmosphere is a product of UV\nradiation acting on oxygen (O ) molecule. The higher energy UV\n2\nradiations split apart some moleculer oxygen (O ) into free oxygen (O)\n2\natoms.", "These atoms then combine with the molecular oxygen to form\nozone as shown—\nO UV→O+O\n2\nO+O →O\n2 3\n(Ozone)\nThe amount of ozone in the atmosphere began to drop sharply in\nthe 1980s. This decrease has been linked to synthetic chemicals like\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which are used as refrigerants and in fire\nextinguishers. In 1987, the United Nations Environment Programme\n(UNEP) succeeded in forging an agreement to freeze CFC production at\n1986 levels. It is now mandatory for all the manufacturing companies\nto make CFC-free refrigerators throughout the world.

Has the size of the hole in the ozone layer changed in\nrecent years? 13.2.2 Managing the Garbage we Produce\nIn our daily activities, we generate a lot of material that are thrown\naway. What are some of these waste materials? What happens after we\nthrow them away? Let us perform an activity to find answers to these\nquestions. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....55555\nn Collect waste material from your homes. This could include all\nthe waste generated during a day, like kitchen waste (spoilt food,\nvegetable peels, used tea leaves, milk packets and empty cartons),\nwaste paper, empty medicine bottles/strips/bubble packs, old and\ntorn clothes and broken footwear. n Bury this material in a pit in the school garden or if there is no\nspace available, you can collect the material in an old bucket/\nflower pot and cover with at least 15 cm of soil. n Keep this material moist and observe at 15-day intervals. n What are the materials that remain unchanged over long periods\nof time? n What are the materials which change their form and structure\nover time? n Of these materials that are changed, which ones change the fastest? Our Environment 213\nReprint 2025-26\nWe have seen in the chapter on ‘Life Processes’ that the food we eat is\ndigested by various enzymes in our body. Have you ever wondered why\nthe same enzyme does not break-down everything we eat? Enzymes are\nspecific in their action, specific enzymes are needed for the break-down\nof a particular substance. That is why we will not get any energy if we\ntry to eat coal! Because of this, many human-made materials like plastics\nwill not be broken down by the action of bacteria or other saprophytes. These materials will be acted upon by physical processes like heat and\npressure, but under the ambient conditions found in our environment,\nthese persist for a long time. Substances that are broken down by biological processes are said\nto be biodegradable. How many of the substances you buried were\nbiodegradable? Substances that are not broken down in this manner\nare said to be non-biodegradable.", "These substances may be inert and\nsimply persist in the environment for a long time or may harm the various\nmembers of the eco-system. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....66666\nn Use the library or internet to find out more about biodegradable\nand non-biodegradable substances. n How long are various non-biodegradable substances expected to\nlast in our environment? n These days, new types of plastics which are said to be biodegradable\nare available.

Give any two ways in which biodegradable substances would affect the\nenvironment. 3. Give any two ways in which non-biodegradable substances would affect\nthe environment. Visit any town or city, and we are sure to find heaps of garbage all over\nthe place. Visit any place of tourist interest and we are sure to find the\nplace littered with empty food wrappers. In the earlier classes we have\ntalked about this problem of dealing with the garbage that we generate. Let\nus now look at the problem a bit more deeply. 214 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111133333.....77777\nn Find out what happens to the waste generated at home.

Are there\nmechanisms in place to ensure that local water bodies are not\npolluted by untreated sewage. n Find out how the local industries in your locality treat their wastes. Are there mechanisms in place to ensure that the soil and water\nare not polluted by this waste? Improvements in our life-style have resulted in greater amounts of\nwaste material generation. Changes in attitude also have a role to play,\nwith more and more things we use becoming disposable. Changes in\npackaging have resulted in much of our waste becoming non-\nbiodegradable. What do you think will be the impact of these on our\nenvironment? Think it over\nDisposable cups in trains\nIf you ask your parents, they will probably remember a time when tea in trains was\nserved in plastic glasses which had to be returned to the vendor. The introduction of\ndisposable cups was hailed as a step forward for reasons of hygiene. No one at that time\nperhaps thought about the impact caused by the disposal of millions of these cups on a\ndaily basis.", "Some time back, kulhads, that is, disposable cups made of clay, were\nsuggested as an alternative. But a little thought showed that making these kulhads on\na large scale would result in the loss of the fertile top-soil. Now disposable paper-cups\nare being used.
