Recall\nthat the portion (or part) of the circular region enclosed\nby two radii and the corresponding arc is called a\nsector of the circle and the portion (or part) of the\ncircular region enclosed between a chord and the\ncorresponding arc is called a segment of the circle. Thus, in Fig. 11.1, shaded region OAPB is a sector\nFig. 11.1\nof the circle with centre O. ∠ AOB is called the\nangle of the sector. Note that in this figure, unshaded region OAQB is also a sector of\nthe circle. For obvious reasons, OAPB is called the minor sector and\nOAQB is called the major sector. You can also see that angle of the major sector is\n360° – ∠ AOB. Now, look at Fig. 11.2 in which AB is a chord\nof the circle with centre O. So, shaded region APB is\na segment of the circle. You can also note that\nunshaded region AQB is another segment of the circle\nformed by the chord AB. For obvious reasons, APB\nis called the minor segment and AQB is called the\nmajor segment. Remark : When we write ‘segment’ and ‘sector’\nwe will mean the ‘minor segment’ and the ‘minor\nsector’ respectively, unless stated otherwise.

Let OAPB be a sector of a circle with centre\nO and radius r (see Fig. 11.3). Let the degree\nmeasure of — AOB be q. You know that area of a circle (in fact of a\ncircular region or disc) is pr2. In a way, we can consider this circular region to\nbe a sector forming an angle of 360° (i.e., of degree\nmeasure 360) at the centre O. Now by applying the Fig. 11.3\nUnitary Method, we can arrive at the area of the\nsector OAPB as follows:\nWhen degree measure of the angle at the centre is 360, area of the\nsector = pr2\nSo, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is 1, area of the\nr2\nsector = \n360\nTherefore, when the degree measure of the angle at the centre is q, area of the\nr2 \nsector =   = r2 . 360 360\nThus, we obtain the following relation (or formula) for area of a sector of a\ncircle:\n\nArea of the sector of angle qqqqq = r2 ,\n360\nwhere r is the radius of the circle and q the angle of the sector in degrees. Now, a natural question arises : Can we find\nthe length of the arc APB corresponding to this\nsector? Yes. Again, by applying the Unitary\nMethod and taking the whole length of the circle\n(of angle 360°) as 2pr, we can obtain the required\n\n2r\nlength of the arc APB as . 360\n\nSo, length of an arc of a sector of angle qqqqq =  2r . 360 Fig. 11.4\nReprint 2025-26\n156 MATHEMATICS\nNow let us take the case of the area of the\nsegment APB of a circle with centre O and radius r\n(see Fig. 11.4). You can see that :\nArea of the segment APB = Area of the sector OAPB – Area of  OAB\n\n= r2 – area of OAB\n360\nNote : From Fig.", "11.3 and Fig. 11.4 respectively, you can observe that:\nArea of the major sector OAQB = r2 – Area of the minor sector OAPB\nand Area of major segment AQB =r2 – Area of the minor segment APB\nLet us now take some examples to understand these concepts (or results). Example 1 : Find the area of the sector of a circle\nwith radius 4 cm and of angle 30°. Also, find the area\nof the corresponding major sector (Use  = 3.14).

(Use  = )\n7\nFig. 11.6\nSolution : Area of the segment AYB\n= Area of sector OAYB – Area of  OAB (1)\n120 22\nNow, area of the sector OAYB =  2121cm2 = 462 cm2 (2)\n360 7\nFor finding the area of  OAB, draw OM  AB as shown in Fig. 11.7.
