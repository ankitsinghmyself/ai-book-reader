Or do they show differences in some of their\n4.6 Genetic Disorders characteristics? Have you ever wondered why siblings\nsometimes look so similar to each other? Or sometimes\neven so different? These and several related questions are dealt with,\nscientifically, in a branch of biology known as Genetics. This subject deals with the inheritance, as well as the\nvariation of characters from parents to offspring. Inheritance is the process by which characters are passed\non from parent to progeny; it is the basis of heredity. Variation is the degree by which progeny differ from their\nparents. Humans knew from as early as 8000-1000 B.C. that\none of the causes of variation was hidden in sexual\nreproduction. They exploited the variations that were\nnaturally present in the wild populations of plants and\nanimals to selectively breed and select for organisms that\npossessed desirable characters. For example, through\nartificial selection and domestication from ancestral\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nwild cows, we have well-known Indian\nbreeds, e.g., Sahiwal cows in Punjab. We\nmust, however, recognise that though our\nancestors knew about the inheritance of\ncharacters and variation, they had very\nlittle idea about the scientific basis of these\nphenomena. 4.1 M ’ L I\nENDEL S AWS OF NHERITANCE\nIt was during the mid-nineteenth century that\nheadway was made in the understanding of\ninheritance. Gregor Mendel, conducted\nhybridisation experiments on garden peas for\nseven years (1856-1863) and proposed the\nlaws of inheritance in living organisms. During\nMendel’s investigations into inheritance\npatterns it was for the first time that statistical\nanalysis and mathematical logic were applied\nto problems in biology. His experiments had a\nlarge sampling size, which gave greater\ncredibility to the data that he collected. Also,\nthe confirmation of his inferences from\nexperiments on successive generations of his\ntest plants, proved that his results pointed to\ngeneral rules of inheritance rather than being\nunsubstantiated ideas. Mendel investigated\ncharacters in the garden pea plant that were\nmanifested as two opposing traits, e.g., tall or\ndwarf plants, yellow or green seeds. This\nallowed him to set up a basic framework of\nrules governing inheritance, which was\nexpanded on by later scientists to account for\nall the diverse natural observations and the\ncomplexity inherent in them. Mendel conducted such artificial\npollination/cross pollination experiments\nFigure 4.1 Seven pairs of contrasting traits in\npea plant studied by Mendel using several true-breeding pea lines. A true-\nbreeding line is one that, having undergone\n54\ncontinuous self-pollination, shows the stable trait inheritance and\nexpression for several generations. Mendel selected 14 true-breeding pea\nplant varieties, as pairs which were similar except for one character with\ncontrasting traits.", "Some of the contrasting traits selected were smooth or\nwrinkled seeds, yellow or green seeds, inflated (full) or constricted green\nor yellow pods and tall or dwarf plants (Figure 4.1, Table 4.1).

He collected the seeds produced\nas a result of this cross and grew them to\ngenerate plants of the first hybrid generation. This generation is also called the Filial\n1\nprogeny or the F . Mendel observed that all\n1\nthe F progeny plants were tall, like one of\n1\nits parents; none were dwarf (Figure 4.3). He\nmade similar observations for the other pairs\nof traits – he found that the F always\n1\nresembled either one of the parents, and that\nthe trait of the other parent was not seen in\nthem. Mendel then self-pollinated the tall F\n1\nplants and to his surprise found that in the\nFilial generation some of the offspring were\n2\n‘dwarf’; the character that was not seen in\nFigure 4.2 Steps in making a cross in pea\nthe F generation was now expressed. The\n1\nproportion of plants that were dwarf were\n1/4th of the F plants while 3/4th of the F plants were tall. The tall and\n2 2\ndwarf traits were identical to their parental type and did not show any\nblending, that is all the offspring were either tall or dwarf, none were of in- 55\nbetween height (Figure 4.3). Similar results were obtained with the other traits that he studied:\nonly one of the parental traits was expressed in the F generation while at\n1\nthe F stage both the traits were expressed in the proportion 3:1. The\n2\ncontrasting traits did not show any blending at either F or F stage. 1 2\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nBased on these observations,\nMendel proposed that something\nwas being stably passed down,\nunchanged, from parent to offspring\nthrough the gametes, over\nsuccessive generations. He called\nthese things as ‘factors’. Now we call\nthem as genes. Genes, therefore, are\nthe units of inheritance. They\ncontain the information that is\nrequired to express a particular trait\nin an organism. Genes which code\nfor a pair of contrasting traits are\nknown as alleles, i.e., they are\nslightly different forms of the same\ngene. If we use alphabetical symbols\nfor each gene, then the capital letter\nis used for the trait expressed at the\nF stage and the small alphabet for\n1\nthe other trait. For example, in case\nof the character of height, T is used\nfor the Tall trait and t for the ‘dwarf’,\nand T and t are alleles of each other.", "Hence, in plants the pair of alleles\nfor height would be TT, Tt or tt. Mendel also proposed that in a true\nFigure 4.3 Diagrammatic representation\nof monohybrid cross breeding, tall or dwarf pea variety\nthe allelic pair of genes for height are\nidentical or homozygous, TT and tt, respectively. TT and tt are called\nthe genotype of the plant while the descriptive terms tall and dwarf are\nthe phenotype. What then would be the phenotype of a plant that had a\ngenotype Tt? As Mendel found the phenotype of the F heterozygote Tt to be exactly\n1\nlike the TT parent in appearance, he proposed that in a pair of dissimilar\nfactors, one dominates the other (as in the F ) and hence is called the\n1\ndominant factor while the other factor is recessive . In this case T (for\ntallness) is dominant over t (for dwarfness), that is recessive. He observed\n56 identical behaviour for all the other characters/trait-pairs that he studied. It is convenient (and logical) to use the capital and lower case of an\nalphabetical symbol to remember this concept of dominance and\nrecessiveness. (Do not use T for tall and d for dwarf because you will\nfind it difficult to remember whether T and d are alleles of the same\ngene/character or not). Alleles can be similar as in the case of homozygotes\nTT and tt or can be dissimilar as in the case of the heterozygote Tt. Since\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nthe Tt plant is heterozygous for genes controlling\none character (height), it is a monohybrid and the\ncross between TT and tt is a monohybrid cross. From the observation that the recessive parental\ntrait is expressed without any blending in the F\n2\ngeneration, we can infer that, when the tall and\ndwarf plant produce gametes, by the process of\nmeiosis, the alleles of the parental pair separate or\nsegregate from each other and only one allele is\ntransmitted to a gamete. This segregation of alleles\nis a random process and so there is a 50 per cent\nchance of a gamete containing either allele, as has\nbeen verified by the results of the crossings. In this\nway the gametes of the tall TT plants have the allele\nT and the gametes of the dwarf tt plants have the\nallele t. During fertilisation the two alleles, T from\none parent say, through the pollen, and t from the\nother parent, then through the egg, are united to\nproduce zygotes that have one T allele and one t\nallele. In other words the hybrids have Tt. Since\nthese hybrids contain alleles which express\ncontrasting traits, the plants are heterozygous. The\nproduction of gametes by the parents, the formation\nof the zygotes, the F and F plants can be\n1 2\nunderstood from a diagram called Punnett Square\nas shown in Figure 4.4. It was developed by a British\ngeneticist, Reginald C. Punnett. It is a graphical\nrepresentation to calculate the probability of all\npossible genotypes of offspring in a genetic cross. The possible gametes are written on two sides,\nusually the top row and left columns.", "All possible\ncombinations are represented in boxes below in the\nsquares, which generates a square output form.

The F plant of 57\n1 1\nthe genotype Tt when self-pollinated, produces gametes of the genotype\nT and t in equal proportion. When fertilisation takes place, the pollen\ngrains of genotype T have a 50 per cent chance to pollinate eggs of the\ngenotype T, as well as of genotype t. Also pollen grains of genotype t have\na 50 per cent chance of pollinating eggs of genotype T, as well as of\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\ngenotype t. As a result of random fertilisation, the resultant zygotes can\nbe of the genotypes TT, Tt or tt. From the Punnett square it is easily seen that 1/4th of the random\nfertilisations lead to TT, 1/2 lead to Tt and 1/4th to tt. Though the F\n1\nhave a genotype of Tt, but the phenotypic character seen is ‘tall’. At F ,\n2\n3/4th of the plants are tall, where some of them are TT while others are\nTt. Externally it is not possible to distinguish between the plants with\nthe genotypes TT and Tt. Hence, within the genopytic pair Tt only one\ncharacter ‘T’ tall is expressed. Hence the character T or ‘tall’ is said to\ndominate over the other allele t or ‘dwarf’ character. It is thus due to this\ndominance of one character over the other that all the F are tall (though\n1\nthe genotype is Tt) and in the F 3/4th of the plants are tall (though\n2\ngenotypically 1/2 are Tt and only 1/4th are TT). This leads to a phenotypic\nratio of 3/4th tall : (1/4 TT + 1/2 Tt) and 1/4th tt, i.e., a 3:1 ratio, but a\ngenotypic ratio of 1:2:1. The 1/4 : 1/2 : 1/4 ratio of TT: Tt: tt is mathematically condensable\nto the form of the binomial expression (ax +by)2, that has the gametes\nbearing genes T or t in equal frequency of ½. The expression is expanded\nas given below :\n(1/2T + 1/2 t)2 = (1/2T + 1/2t) X (1/2T + 1/2t) = 1/4 TT + 1/2Tt + 1/4 tt\nMendel self-pollinated the F plants and found that dwarf F plants\n2 2\ncontinued to generate dwarf plants in F and F generations. He concluded\n3 4\nthat the genotype of the dwarfs was homozygous – tt. What do you think\nhe would have got had he self-pollinated a tall F plant? 2\nFrom the preceeding paragraphs it is clear that though the genotypic\nratios can be calculated using mathematical probability, by simply looking\nat the phenotype of a dominant trait, it is not possible to know the\ngenotypic composition. That is, for example, whether a tall plant from F\n1\nor F has TT or Tt composition, cannot be predicted.", "Therefore, to determine\n2\nthe genotype of a tall plant at F , Mendel crossed the tall plant from F\n2 2\nwith a dwarf plant. This he called a test cross. In a typical test cross an\norganism (pea plants here) showing a dominant phenotype (and whose\ngenotype is to be determined) is crossed with the recessive parent instead\nof self-crossing. The progenies of such a cross can easily be analysed to\npredict the genotype of the test organism. Figure 4.5 shows the results of\ntypical test cross where violet colour flower (V) is dominant over white\n58\ncolour flower (v). Using Punnett square, try to find out the nature of offspring of a test cross. What ratio did you get? Using the genotypes of this cross, can you give a general definition for a\ntest cross? Reprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nFigure 4.5 Diagrammatic representation of a test cross\nBased on his observations on monohybrid crosses Mendel proposed\ntwo general rules to consolidate his understanding of inheritance in\nmonohybrid crosses. Today these rules are called the Principles or\nLaws of Inheritance: the First Law or Law of Dominance and the\nSecond Law or Law of Segregation. 4.2.1 Law of Dominance\n(i) Characters are controlled by discrete units called factors. (ii) Factors occur in pairs. (iii) In a dissimilar pair of factors one member of the pair dominates\n(dominant) the other (recessive). The law of dominance is used to explain the expression of only one of\nthe parental characters in a monohybrid cross in the F and the expression\n1\nof both in the F . It also explains the proportion of 3:1 obtained at the F . 2 2\n4.2.2 Law of Segregation\nThis law is based on the fact that the alleles do not show any blending\nand that both the characters are recovered as such in the F generation\n59\n2\nthough one of these is not seen at the F stage. Though the parents contain\n1\ntwo alleles during gamete formation, the factors or alleles of a pair segregate\nfrom each other such that a gamete receives only one of the two factors. Of course, a homozygous parent produces all gametes that are similar\nwhile a heterozygous one produces two kinds of gametes each having\none allele with equal proportion. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n4.2.2.1 Incomplete Dominance\nWhen experiments on peas were repeated using other\ntraits in other plants, it was found that sometimes\nthe F had a phenotype that did not resemble either\n1\nof the two parents and was in between the two. The\ninheritance of flower colour in the dog flower\n(snapdragon or Antirrhinum sp.) is a good example\nto understand incomplete dominance. In a cross\nbetween true-breeding red-flowered (RR) and true-\nbreeding white-flowered plants (rr), the F (Rr) was\n1\npink (Figure 4.6). When the F was self-pollinated\n1\nthe F resulted in the following ratio 1 (RR) Red: 2\n2\n(Rr) Pink: 1 (rr) White. Here the genotype ratios were\nexactly as we would expect in any mendelian\nmonohybrid cross, but the phenotype ratios had\nchanged from the 3:1 dominant : recessive ratio.", "What happened was that R was not completely\ndominant over r and this made it possible to\ndistinguish Rr as pink from RR (red) and rr (white) . Explanation of the concept of dominance:\nWhat exactly is dominance? Why are some alleles\ndominant and some recessive? To tackle these\nquestions, we must understand what a gene does. Every gene, as you know by now, contains the\ninformation to express a particular trait. In a\ndiploid organism, there are two copies of each\ngene, i.e., as a pair of alleles. Now, these two alleles\nneed not always be identical, as in a heterozygote. One of them may be different due to some changes\nthat it has undergone (about which you will read\nfurther on, and in the next chapter) which modifies\nthe information that particular allele contains. Let’s take an example of a gene that contains\nthe information for producing an enzyme. Now\nFigure 4.6 Results of monohybrid cross in\nthere are two copies of this gene, the two allelic\nthe plant Snapdragon, where\none allele is incompletely forms. Let us assume (as is more common) that\ndominant over the other allele the normal allele produces the normal enzyme\nthat is needed for the transformation of a\n60\nsubstrate S. Theoretically, the modified allele could be responsible for\nproduction of –\n(i) the normal/less efficient enzyme, or\n(ii) a non-functional enzyme, or\n(iii) no enzyme at all\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nIn the first case, the modified allele is equivalent to the unmodified allele,\ni.e., it will produce the same phenotype/trait, i.e., result in the transformation\nof substrate S. Such equivalent allele pairs are very common. But, if the\nallele produces a non-functional enzyme or no enzyme, the phenotype may\nbe effected. The phenotype/trait will only be dependent on the functioning\nof the unmodified allele. The unmodified (functioning) allele, which represents\nthe original phenotype is the dominant allele and the modified allele is\ngenerally the recessive allele. Hence, in the example above the recessive trait\nis seen due to non-functional enzyme or because no enzyme is produced. 4.2.2.2 Co-dominance\nTill now we were discussing crosses where the F resembled either of the\n1\ntwo parents (dominance) or was in-between (incomplete dominance). But,\nin the case of co-dominance the F generation resembles both parents. A\n1\ngood example is different types of red blood cells that determine ABO\nblood grouping in human beings. ABO blood groups are controlled by\nthe gene I. The plasma membrane of the red blood cells has sugar polymers\nthat protrude from its surface and the kind of sugar is controlled by the\ngene. The gene (I) has three alleles IA, IB and i. The alleles IA and IB produce\na slightly different form of the sugar while allele i does not produce any\nsugar. Because humans are diploid organisms, each person possesses\nany two of the three I gene alleles.", "IA and IB are completely dominant over\ni, in other words when IA and i are present only IA expresses (because i\ndoes not produce any sugar), and when IB and i are present IB expresses. But when IA and IB are present together they both express their own types\nof sugars: this is because of co-dominance. Hence red blood cells have\nboth A and B types of sugars. Since there are three different alleles, there\nare six different combinations of these three alleles that are possible, and\ntherefore, a total of six different genotypes of the human ABO blood types\n(Table 4.2). How many phenotypes are possible?

Here you can see that there are\nmore than two, i.e., three alleles, governing the same character. Since in\nan individual only two alleles can be present, multiple alleles can be found\nonly when population studies are made. Occasionally, a single gene product may produce more than one effect. For example, starch synthesis in pea seeds is controlled by one gene. It\nhas two alleles (B and b). Starch is synthesised effectively by BB\nhomozygotes and therefore, large starch grains are produced. In contrast,\nbb homozygotes have lesser efficiency in starch synthesis and produce\nsmaller starch grains. After maturation of the seeds, BB seeds are round\nand the bb seeds are wrinkled. Heterozygotes produce round seeds, and\nso B seems to be the dominant allele. But, the starch grains produced are\nof intermediate size in Bb seeds. So if starch grain size is considered as\nthe phenotype, then from this angle, the alleles show incomplete\ndominance. Therefore, dominance is not an autonomous feature of a gene or the\nproduct that it has information for. It depends as much on the gene\nproduct and the production of a particular phenotype from this product\nas it does on the particular phenotype that we choose to examine, in case\nmore than one phenotype is influenced by the same gene. 4.3 I T G\nNHERITANCE OF WO ENES\nMendel also worked with and crossed pea plants that differed in two\ncharacters, as is seen in the cross between a pea plant that has seeds with\nyellow colour and round shape and one that had seeds of green colour\nand wrinkled shape (Figure 4.7). Mendel found that the seeds resulting\nfrom the crossing of the parents, had yellow coloured and round shaped\nseeds. Here can you tell which of the characters in the pairs yellow/\ngreen colour and round/wrinkled shape was dominant? Thus, yellow colour was dominant over green and round shape\ndominant over wrinkled.", "These results were identical to those that he got\nwhen he made separate monohybrid crosses between yellow and green\nseeded plants and between round and wrinkled seeded plants. Let us use the genotypic symbols Y for dominant yellow seed colour\nand y for recessive green seed colour, R for round shaped seeds and r for\nwrinkled seed shape. The genotype of the parents can then be written as\nRRYY and rryy. The cross between the two plants can be written down\n62\nas in Figure 4.7 showing the genotypes of the parent plants. The gametes\nRY and ry unite on fertilisation to produce the F hybrid RrYy. When\n1\nMendel self hybridised the F plants he found that 3/4th of F plants had\n1 2\nyellow seeds and 1/4th had green. The yellow and green colour segregated\nin a 3:1 ratio. Round and wrinkled seed shape also segregated in a 3:1\nratio; just like in a monohybrid cross.

Such a ratio was observed for several pairs of characters\nthat Mendel studied. The ratio of 9:3:3:1 can be derived as a combination series of 3 yellow:\n1 green, with 3 round : 1 wrinkled. This derivation can be written\nas follows:\n(3 Round : 1 Wrinkled) (3 Yellow : 1 Green) = 9 Round, Yellow : 3\nWrinkled, Yellow: 3 Round, Green : 1 Wrinkled, Green\nBased upon such observations on dihybrid crosses (crosses between\nplants differing in two traits) Mendel proposed a second set of generalisations\nthat we call Mendel’s Law of Independent Assortment. The law states that\n‘when two pairs of traits are combined in a hybrid, segregation of one pair\nof characters is independent of the other pair of characters’. The Punnett square can be effectively used to understand the\nindependent segregation of the two pairs of genes during meiosis and\nthe production of eggs and pollen in the F RrYy plant. Consider the\n1\nsegregation of one pair of genes R and r. Fifty per cent of the gametes\nhave the gene R and the other 50 per cent have r. Now besides each\ngamete having either R or r, it should also have the allele Y or y. The\nimportant thing to remember here is that segregation of 50 per cent R\nand 50 per cent r is independent from the segregation of 50 per cent\nY and 50 per cent y. Therefore, 50 per cent of the r bearing gametes\nhas Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Similarly, 50 per cent of the R\nbearing gametes has Y and the other 50 per cent has y. Thus there are\nfour genotypes of gametes (four types of pollen and four types of eggs). The four types are RY, Ry, rY and ry each with a frequency of 25 per\ncent or 1/4th of the total gametes produced.", "When you write down the\nfour types of eggs and pollen on the two sides of a Punnett square it is\nvery easy to derive the composition of the zygotes that give rise to the\nF plants (Figure 4.7). Although there are 16 squares how many\n2\ndifferent types of genotypes and phenotypes are formed? Note them\ndown in the format given.

Firstly,\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\ncommunication was not easy (as it is now) in those days and his work\ncould not be widely publicised. Secondly, his concept of genes (or\nfactors, in Mendel’s words) as stable and discrete units that controlled\nthe expression of traits and, of the pair of alleles which did not ‘blend’\nwith each other, was not accepted by his contemporaries as an\nexplanation for the apparently continuous variation seen in nature. Thirdly, Mendel’s approach of using mathematics to explain biological\nphenomena was totally new and unacceptable to many of the\nbiologists of his time. Finally, though Mendel’s work suggested that\nfactors (genes) were discrete units, he could not provide any physical\nproof for the existence of factors or say what they were made of. In 1900, three Scientists (de Vries, Correns and von Tschermak)\nindependently rediscovered Mendel’s results on the inheritance of\ncharacters. Also, by this time due to advancements in microscopy that\nwere taking place, scientists were able to carefully observe cell division. This led to the discovery of structures in the nucleus that appeared to\ndouble and divide just before each cell division. These were called\nchromosomes (colored bodies, as they were visualised by staining). By\n1902, the chromosome movement during meiosis had been worked out. Walter Sutton and Theodore Boveri noted that the behaviour of\nchromosomes was parallel to the behaviour of genes and used\nchromosome movement (Figure 4.8) to explain Mendel’s laws (Table 4.3). Recall that you have studied the behaviour of chromosomes during mitosis\n(equational division) and during meiosis (reduction division). The\nimportant things to remember are that chromosomes as well as genes\noccur in pairs. The two alleles of a gene pair are located on homologous\nsites on homologous chromosomes. 65\nFigure 4.8 Meiosis and germ cell formation in a cell with four chromosomes. Can you see how chromosomes segregate when germ cells\nare formed?", "Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nTable 4.3: A Comparison between the Behaviour of Chromosomes\nand Genes\nA B\nOccur in pairs Occur in pairs\nSegregate at the time of gamete Segregate at gamete formation and only\nformation such that only one of each one of each pair is transmitted to a\npair is transmitted to a gamete gamete\nIndependent pairs segregate One pair segregates independently of\nindependently of each other another pair\nCan you tell which of these columns A or B represent the chromosome\nand which represents the gene? How did you decide? During Anaphase of meiosis I, the two chromosome pairs can align at\nthe metaphase plate independently of each other (Figure 4.9). To\nunderstand this, compare the chromosomes of four different colour in\nthe left and right columns. In the left column (Possibility I) orange and\ngreen is segregating together.

Sutton united the knowledge of chromosomal\nsegregation with Mendelian principles and called it the\nchromosomal theory of inheritance. Following this synthesis of ideas, experimental verification of\nthe chromosomal theory of inheritance by Thomas Hunt Morgan\nand his colleagues, led to discovering the basis for the variation (a) (b)\nthat sexual reproduction produced. Morgan worked with the tiny Figure 4.10 Drosophila\nfruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (Figure 4.10), which were melanogaster (a) Male\n(b) Female\nfound very suitable for such studies. They could be grown on\nsimple synthetic medium in the laboratory. They complete their life\ncycle in about two weeks, and a single mating could produce a large\nnumber of progeny flies. Also, there was a clear differentiation of the\nsexes – the male and female flies are easily distinguishable. Also, it\nhas many types of hereditary variations that can be seen with low\npower microscopes. 4.3.3 Linkage and Recombination\nMorgan carried out several dihybrid crosses in Drosophila to study genes\nthat were sex-linked. The crosses were similar to the dihybrid crosses carried\nout by Mendel in peas. For example Morgan hybridised yellow-bodied,\nwhite-eyed females to brown-bodied, red-eyed males and intercrossed their\nF progeny. He observed that the two genes did not segregate independently\n1\nof each other and the F ratio deviated very significantly from the 9:3:3:1\n2\nratio (expected when the two genes are independent).", "Morgan and his group knew that the genes were located on the X\nchromosome (Section 4.4) and saw quickly that when the two genes in a\ndihybrid cross were situated on the same chromosome, the proportion\nof parental gene combinations were much higher than the non-parental\ntype. Morgan attributed this due to the physical association or linkage\nof the two genes and coined the term linkage to describe this physical\nassociation of genes on a chromosome and the term recombination to\ndescribe the generation of non-parental gene combinations (Figure 4.11). Morgan and his group also found that even when genes were grouped\non the same chromosome, some genes were very tightly linked (showed\nvery low recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross A) while others were loosely\nlinked (showed higher recombination) (Figure 4.11, Cross B). For 67\nexample he found that the genes white and yellow were very tightly linked\nand showed only 1.3 per cent recombination while white and miniature\nwing showed 37.2 per cent recombination. His student Alfred\nSturtevant used the frequency of recombination between gene pairs\non the same chromosome as a measure of the distance between genes\nand ‘mapped’ their position on the chromosome. Today genetic maps\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nare extensively used as a starting point in the sequencing of whole\ngenomes as was done in the case of the Human Genome Sequencing\nProject, described later. 6688\nFigure 4.11 Linkage: Results of two dihybrid crosses conducted by Morgan.

Reprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n4.4 P I\nOLYGENIC NHERITANCE\nMendel’s studies mainly described those traits that have distinct alternate\nforms such as flower colour which are either purple or white. But if you\nlook around you will find that there are many traits which are not so\ndistinct in their occurrence and are spread across a gradient. For example,\nin humans we don’t just have tall or short people as two distinct\nalternatives but a whole range of possible heights. Such traits are generally\ncontrolled by three or more genes and are thus called as polygenic traits. Besides the involvement of multiple genes polygenic inheritance also takes\ninto account the influence of environment. Human skin colour is another\nclassic example for this. In a polygenic trait the phenotype reflects the\ncontribution of each allele, i.e., the effect of each allele is additive. To\nunderstand this better let us assume that three genes A, B, C control skin\ncolour in human with the dominant forms A, B and C responsible for\ndark skin colour and the recessive forms a, b and c for light skin colour.", "The genotype with all the dominant alleles (AABBCC) will have the darkest\nskin colour and that with all the recessive alleles (aabbcc) will have the\nlightest skin colour. As expected the genotype with three dominant alleles\nand three recessive alleles will have an intermediate skin colour. In this\nmanner the number of each type of alleles in the genotype would determine\nthe darkness or lightness of the skin in an individual. 4.5 P\nLEIOTROPY\nWe have so far seen the effect of a gene on a single phenotype or trait. There are however instances where a single gene can exhibit multiple\nphenotypic expression. Such a gene is called a pleiotropic gene. The\nunderlying mechanism of pleiotropy in most cases is the effect of a gene\non metabolic pathways which contribute towards different phenotypes. An example of this is the disease phenylketonuria, which occurs in\nhumans. The disease is caused by mutation in the gene that codes for the\nenzyme phenyl alanine hydroxylase (single gene mutation). This manifests\nitself through phenotypic expression characterised by mental\nretardation and a reduction in hair and skin pigmentation. 4.6 S D\nEX ETERMINATION\nThe mechanism of sex determination has always been a puzzle before the\ngeneticists. The initial clue about the genetic/chromosomal mechanism\nof sex determination can be traced back to some of the experiments carried\nout in insects. In fact, the cytological observations made in a number of\ninsects led to the development of the concept of genetic/chromosomal\n69\nbasis of sex-determination. Henking (1891) could trace a specific nuclear\nstructure all through spermatogenesis in a few insects, and it was also\nobserved by him that 50 per cent of the sperm received this structure\nafter spermatogenesis, whereas the other 50 per cent sperm did not receive\nit. Henking gave a name to this structure as the X body but he could not\nexplain its significance. Further investigations by other scientists led to\nthe conclusion that the ‘X body’ of Henking was in fact a chromosome\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nand that is why it was given the name\nX-chromosome. It was also observed that in\na large number of insects the mechanism of\nsex determination is of the XO type, i.e., all\neggs bear an additional X-chromosome\nbesides the other chromosomes\n(autosomes). On the other hand, some of the\nsperms bear the X-chromosome whereas\nsome do not. Eggs fertilised by sperm having\n(a) an X-chromosome become females and,\nthose fertilised by sperms that do not have\nan X-chromosome become males. Do you\nthink the number of chromosomes in the\nmale and female are equal? Due to the\ninvolvement of the X-chromosome in the\ndetermination of sex, it was designated to\n(b) be the sex chromosome, and the rest of the\nchromosomes were named as\nautosomes.Grasshopper is an example of\nXO type of sex determination in which the\nmales have only one X-chromosome besides\nthe autosomes, whereas females have a pair\nof X-chromosomes.", "These observations led to the\ninvestigation of a number of species to\n(c)\nunderstand the mechanism of sex\ndetermination. In a number of other insects\nFigure 4.12 Determination of sex by chromosomal\nand mammals including man, XY type of sex\ndifferences: (a,b) Both in humans and\ndetermination is seen where both male and\nin Drosophila, the female has a pair of\nXX chromosomes (homogametic) and the female have same number of chromosomes. male XY (heterogametic) composition; Among the males an X-chromosome is\n(c) In many birds, female has a pair of present but its counter part is distinctly\ndissimilar chromosomes ZW and male\nsmaller and called the Y-chromosome. two similar ZZ chromosomes\nFemales, however, have a pair of X-\nchromosomes. Both males and females bear\nsame number of autosomes. Hence, the males have autosomes plus XY,\nwhile female have autosomes plus XX. In human beings and in\nDrosophila the males have one X and one Y chromosome, whereas females\nhave a pair of X-chromosomes besides autosomes (Figure 4.12 a, b). In the above description you have studied about two types of sex\ndetermining mechanisms, i.e., XO type and XY type. But in both cases\n70 males produce two different types of gametes, (a) either with or without\nX-chromosome or (b) some gametes with X-chromosome and some with\nY-chromosome. Such types of sex determination mechanism is designated\nto be the example of male heterogamety. In some other organisms, e.g.,\nbirds, a different mechanism of sex determination is observed (Figure\n4.12 c). In this case the total number of chromosome is same in both\nmales and females. But two different types of gametes in terms of the sex\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nchromosomes, are produced by females, i.e., female heterogamety. In\norder to have a distinction with the mechanism of sex determination\ndescribed earlier, the two different sex chromosomes of a female bird has\nbeen designated to be the Z and W chromosomes. In these organisms the\nfemales have one Z and one W chromosome, whereas males have a pair of\nZ-chromosomes besides the autosomes. 4.6.1 Sex Determination in Humans\nIt has already been mentioned that the sex determining mechanism in\ncase of humans is XY type. Out of 23 pairs of chromosomes present,\n22 pairs are exactly same in both males and females; these are the\nautosomes. A pair of X-chromosomes are present in the female, whereas\nthe presence of an X and Y chromosome are determinant of the male\ncharacteristic. During spermatogenesis among males, two types of\ngametes are produced. 50 per cent of the total sperm produced carry\nthe X-chromosome and the rest 50 per cent has Y-chromosome besides\nthe autosomes. Females, however, produce only one type of ovum with\nan X-chromosome. There is an equal probability of fertilisation of the\novum with the sperm carrying either X or Y chromosome.", "In case the\novum fertilises with a sperm carrying X-chromosome the zygote develops\ninto a female (XX) and the fertilisation of ovum with Y-chromosome\ncarrying sperm results into a male offspring. Thus, it is evident that it\nis the genetic makeup of the sperm that determines the sex of the child. It is also evident that in each pregnancy there is always 50 per cent\nprobability of either a male or a female child. It is unfortunate that in\nour society women are blamed for giving birth to female children and\nhave been ostracised and ill-treated because of this false notion. 4.6.2 Sex Determination in Honey Bee\nThe sex determination in honey bee is\nbased on the number of sets of\nchromosomes an individual receives. An\noffspring formed from the union of a\nsperm and an egg develops as a female\n(queen or worker), and an unfertilised\negg develops as a male (drone) by means\nof parthenogenesis. This means that the\nmales have half the number of\nchromosomes than that of a female. The Figure 4.13 Sex determination in honey bee\nfemales are diploid having 32\nchromosomes and males are haploid, i.e., having 16 chromosomes. 71\nThis is called as haplodiploid sex-determination system and has special\ncharacteristic features such as the males produce sperms by mitosis\n(Figure 4.13), they do not have father and thus cannot have sons, but\nhave a grandfather and can have grandsons. How is the sex-determination mechanism different in the birds? Is the sperm or the egg responsible for the sex of the chicks? Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\n4.7 M\nUTATION\nMutation is a phenomenon which results in alteration of DNA sequences\nand consequently results in changes in the genotype and the phenotype\nof an organism. In addition to recombination, mutation is another\nphenomenon that leads to variation in DNA. As you will learn in Chapter 5, one DNA helix runs continuously from\none end to the other in each chromatid, in a highly supercoiled form. Therefore loss (deletions) or gain (insertion/duplication) of a segment of\nDNA, result in alteration in chromosomes. Since genes are known to be\nlocated on chromosomes, alteration in chromosomes results in\nabnormalities or aberrations. Chromosomal\naberrations are commonly observed in cancer cells. In addition to the above, mutation also arise due\nto change in a single base pair of DNA. This is known\nas point mutation. A classical example of such a\nmutation is sickle cell anemia. Deletions and insertions\nof base pairs of DNA, causes frame-shift mutations\n(see Chapter 5). The mechanism of mutation is beyond the scope\nof this discussion, at this level. However, there are\nmany chemical and physical factors that induce\nmutations. These are referred to as mutagens. UV\nradiations can cause mutations in organisms – it is a\nmutagen. 4.8 G D\nENETIC ISORDERS\n4.8.1 Pedigree Analysis\nThe idea that disorders are inherited has been\nprevailing in the human society since long. This was\nbased on the heritability of certain characteristic\nfeatures in families.", "After the rediscovery of Mendel’s\nwork the practice of analysing inheritance pattern of\ntraits in human beings began. Since it is evident that\ncontrol crosses that can be performed in pea plant or\nsome other organisms, are not possible in case of\nFigure 4.13Symbols used in the human\npedigree analysis human beings, study of the family history about\ninheritance of a particular trait provides an\nalternative. Such an analysis of traits in a several of generations of a family\nis called the pedigree analysis. In the pedigree analysis the inheritance\n72 of a particular trait is represented in the family tree over generations. In human genetics, pedigree study provides a strong tool, which is\nutilised to trace the inheritance of a specific trait, abnormality or disease. Some of the important standard symbols used in the pedigree analysis\nhave been shown in Figure 4.13. As you have studied in this chapter, each and every feature in any\norganism is controlled by one or the other gene located on the DNA present\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nin the chromosome. DNA is the carrier of genetic information. It is hence\ntransmitted from one generation to the other without any change or\nalteration. However, changes or alteration do take place occasionally. Such\nan alteration or change in the genetic material is referred to as mutation. A number of disorders in human beings have been found to be associated\nwith the inheritance of changed or altered genes or chromosomes. 4.8.2 Mendelian Disorders\nBroadly, genetic disorders may be grouped into two categories – Mendelian\ndisorders and Chromosomal disorders. Mendelian disorders are mainly\ndetermined by alteration or mutation in the single gene. These disorders\nare transmitted to the offspring on the same lines as we have studied in\nthe principle of inheritance. The pattern of inheritance of such Mendelian\ndisorders can be traced in a family by the pedigree analysis. Most common\nand prevalent Mendelian disorders are Haemophilia, Cystic fibrosis, Sickle-\ncell anaemia, Colour blindness, Phenylketonuria, Thalassemia, etc. It is\nimportant to mention here that such Mendelian disorders may be\ndominant or recessive. By pedigree analysis one can easily understand\nwhether the trait in question is dominant or recessive. Similarly, the trait\nmay also be linked to the sex chromosome as in case of haemophilia. It is\nevident that this X-linked recessive trait shows transmission from carrier\nfemale to male progeny. A representative pedigree is shown in Figure 4.14\nfor dominant and recessive traits. Discuss with your teacher and design\npedigrees for characters linked to both autosomes and sex chromosome.", "(a) (b)\nFigure 4.14Representative pedigree analysis of (a) Autosomal dominant trait (for example:\nMyotonic dystrophy) (b) Autosomal recessive trait (for example: Sickle-cell anaemia)\nColour Blindness : It is a sex-linked recessive disorder due to defect in 73\neither red or green cone of eye resulting in failure to discriminate between\nred and green colour. This defect is due to mutation in certain genes\npresent in the X chromosome. It occurs in about 8 per cent of males and\nonly about 0.4 per cent of females. This is because the genes that lead to\nred-green colour blindness are on the X chromosome. Males have only\none X chromosome and females have two. The son of a woman who carries\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nthe gene has a 50 per cent chance of being colour blind. The mother is\nnot herself colour blind because the gene is recessive. That means that its\neffect is suppressed by her matching dominant normal gene. A daughter\nwill not normally be colour blind, unless her mother is a carrier and her\nfather is colour blind. Haemophilia : This sex linked recessive disease, which shows its\ntransmission from unaffected carrier female to some of the male progeny\nhas been widely studied. In this disease, a single protein that is a part of\nthe cascade of proteins involved in the clotting of blood is affected. Due to\nthis, in an affected individual a simple cut will result in non-stop bleeding. The heterozygous female (carrier) for haemophilia may transmit the disease\nto sons. The possibility of a female becoming a haemophilic is extremely\nrare because mother of such a female has to be at least carrier and the\nfather should be haemophilic (unviable in the later stage of life). The family\npedigree of Queen Victoria shows a number of haemophilic descendents\nas she was a carrier of the disease. Sickle-cell anaemia : This is an autosome linked recessive trait that\ncan be transmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners\nare carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The disease is controlled by a\nsingle pair of allele, HbA and HbS. Out of the three possible genotypes only\nhomozygous individuals for HbS (HbSHbS) show the diseased phenotype. Heterozygous (HbAHbS) individuals appear apparently unaffected but they\nare carrier of the disease as there is 50 per cent probability of transmission\nof the mutant gene to the progeny, thus exhibiting sickle-cell trait\n(Figure 4.15). The defect is caused by the substitution of Glutamic acid\n74\nFigure 4.15 Micrograph of the red blood cells and the amino acid composition of the relevant\nportion of β-chain of haemoglobin: (a) From a normal individual; (b) From an individual\nwith sickle-cell anaemia\nReprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\n(Glu) by Valine (Val) at the sixth position of the beta globin chain of the\nhaemoglobin molecule. The substitution of amino acid in the globin\nprotein results due to the single base substitution at the sixth codon of\nthe beta globin gene from GAG to GUG.", "The mutant haemoglobin molecule\nundergoes polymerisation under low oxygen tension causing the change\nin the shape of the RBC from biconcave disc to elongated sickle like\nstructure (Figure 4.15). Phenylketonuria : This inborn error of metabolism is also inherited as\nthe autosomal recessive trait. The affected individual lacks an enzyme\nthat converts the amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine. As a result of\nthis phenylalanine is accumulated and converted into phenylpyruvic acid\nand other derivatives. Accumulation of these in brain results in mental\nretardation. These are also excreted through urine because of its poor\nabsorption by kidney. Thalassemia : This is also an autosome-linked recessive blood disease\ntransmitted from parents to the offspring when both the partners are\nunaffected carrier for the gene (or heterozygous). The defect could be due\nto either mutation or deletion which ultimately results in reduced rate of\nsynthesis of one of the globin chains (α and β chains) that make up\nhaemoglobin. This causes the formation of abnormal haemoglobin\nmolecules resulting into anaemia which is characteristic of the disease. Thalassemia can be classified according to which chain of the haemoglobin\nmolecule is affected. In α Thalassemia, production of α globin chain is\naffected while in β Thalassemia, production of β globin chain is affected. α Thalassemia is controlled by two closely linked genes HBA1 and HBA2\non chromosome 16 of each parent and it is observed due to mutation or\ndeletion of one or more of the four genes. The more genes affected, the\nless alpha globin molecules produced. While β Thalassemia is controlled\nby a single gene HBB on chromosome 11 of each parent and occurs due\nto mutation of one or both the genes. Thalassemia differs from sickle-cell\nanaemia in that the former is a quantitative problem of synthesising too\nfew globin molecules while the latter is a qualitative problem of\nsynthesising an incorrectly functioning globin. 4.8.3 Chromosomal Disorders\nThe chromosomal disorders on the other hand are caused due to absence\nor excess or abnormal arrangement of one or more chromosomes. Failure of segregation of chromatids during cell division cycle results\nin the gain or loss of a chromosome(s), called aneuploidy. For example,\nDown’s syndrome results in the gain of extra copy of chromosome 21. Similarly, Turner’s syndrome results due to loss of an X chromosome in\nhuman females. Failure of cytokinesis after telophase stage of cell division\n75\nresults in an increase in a whole set of chromosomes in an organism and,\nthis phenomenon is known as polyploidy. This condition is often seen in\nplants. The total number of chromosomes in a normal human cell is 46\n(23 pairs). Out of these 22 pairs are autosomes and one pair of\nchromosomes are sex chromosome.", "Sometimes, though rarely, either an\nadditional copy of a chromosome may be included in an individual or an\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nFlat back of head Broad flat face\nMany “loops” on\nfinger tips\nBig and wrinkled\nPalm crease tongue\nCongenital heart\ndisease\nFigure 4.16 A representative figure showing an individual inflicted with Down’s\nsyndrome and the corresponding chromosomes of the individual\nindividual may lack one of any one pair of\nchromosomes.

Down’s Syndrome : The cause of this genetic disorder\nis the presence of an additional copy of the\nchromosome number 21 (trisomy of 21). This disorder\nwas first described by Langdon Down (1866).

Reprint 2025-26\nPRINCIPLES OF INHERITANCE AND VARIATION\nSUMMARY\nGenetics is a branch of biology which deals with principles of inheritance\nand its practices. Progeny resembling the parents in morphological and\nphysiological features has attracted the attention of many biologists. Mendel was the first to study this phenomenon systematically. While\nstudying the pattern of inheritance in pea plants of contrasting\ncharacters, Mendel proposed the principles of inheritance, which are\ntoday referred to as ‘Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance’. He proposed that\nthe ‘factors’ (later named as genes) regulating the characters are found\nin pairs known as alleles. He observed that the expression of the\ncharacters in the offspring follow a definite pattern in different–first\ngenerations (F ), second (F ) and so on. Some characters are dominant\n1 2\nover others. The dominant characters are expressed when factors are\nin heterozygous condition (Law of Dominance).", "The recessive characters\nare only expressed in homozygous conditions. The characters never\nblend in heterozygous condition. A recessive character that was not\nexpressed in heterozygous conditon may be expressed again when it\nbecomes homozygous. Hence, characters segregate while formation of\ngametes (Law of Segregation). Not all characters show true dominance. Some characters show\nincomplete, and some show co-dominance. When Mendel studied the\ninheritance of two characters together, it was found that the factors\nindependently assort and combine in all permutations and\ncombinations (Law of Independent Assortment). Different combinations\nof gametes are theoretically represented in a square tabular form known\nas ‘Punnett Square’. The factors (now known as gene) on chromosomes\nregulating the characters are called the genotype and the physical\nexpression of the chraracters is called phenotype. After knowing that the genes are located on the chromosomes, a\ngood correlation was drawn between Mendel’s laws : segregation and\nassortment of chromosomes during meiosis. The Mendel’s laws were\nextended in the form of ‘Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance’. Later, it\nwas found that Mendel’s law of independent assortment does not hold\ntrue for the genes that were located on the same chromosomes. These\ngenes were called as ‘linked genes’. Closely located genes assorted\ntogether, and distantly located genes, due to recombination, assorted\nindependently. Linkage maps, therefore, corresponded to arrangement\nof genes on a chromosome. Many genes were linked to sexes also, and called as sex-linked\ngenes. The two sexes (male and female) were found to have a set of\nchromosomes which were common, and another set which was\ndifferent. The chromosomes which were different in two sexes were\nnamed as sex chromosomes. The remaining set was named as\nautosomes. In humans, a normal female has 22 pairs of autosomes\nand a pair of sex chromosomes (XX). A male has 22 pairs of autosomes\n77\nand a pair of sex chromosome as XY. In chicken, sex chromosomes in\nmale are ZZ, and in females are ZW. Mutation is defined as change in the genetic material. A point\nmutation is a change of a single base pair in DNA. Sickle-cell anemia is\ncaused due to change of one base in the gene coding for beta-chain of\nhemoglobin. Inheritable mutations can be studied by generating a\npedigree of a family. Some mutations involve changes in whole set of\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nchromosomes (polyploidy) or change in a subset of chromosome number\n(aneuploidy). This helped in understanding the mutational basis of\ngenetic disorders. Down’s syndrome is due to trisomy of chromosome 21,\nwhere there is an extra copy of chromosome 21 and consequently the\ntotal number of chromosome becomes 47. In Turner’s syndrome, one X\nchromosome is missing and the sex chromosome is as XO, and in\nKlinefelter’s syndrome, the condition is XXY. These can be easily studied\nby analysis of Karyotypes.
