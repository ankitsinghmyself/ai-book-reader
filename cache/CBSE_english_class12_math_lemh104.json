STEINMETZ\n4.1 Introduction\nIn the previous chapter, we have studied about matrices\nand algebra of matrices. We have also learnt that a system\nof algebraic equations can be expressed in the form of\nmatrices. This means, a system of linear equations like\na x + b y =c\n1 1 1\na x + b y =c\n2 2 2\na b  x c \ncan be represented as 1 1 = 1 . Now, this\n     \na 2 b 2 y c 2\nsystem of equations has a unique solution or not, is\ndetermined by the number a b – a b . (Recall that if\n1 2 2 1\na b\n1 ≠ 1 or, a b – a b ≠ 0, then the system of linear P.S. Laplace\na b 1 2 2 1 (1749-1827)\n2 2\nequations has a unique solution). The number a b – a b\n1 2 2 1\na b \nwhich determines uniqueness of solution is associated with the matrix A= 1 1\n \na 2 b 2\nand is called the determinant of A or det A. Determinants have wide applications in\nEngineering, Science, Economics, Social Science, etc. In this chapter, we shall study determinants up to order three only with real entries. Also, we will study various properties of determinants, minors, cofactors and applications\nof determinants in finding the area of a triangle, adjoint and inverse of a square matrix,\nconsistency and inconsistency of system of linear equations and solution of linear\nequations in two or three variables using inverse of a matrix. 4.2 Determinant\nTo every square matrix A = [a ] of order n, we can associate a number (real or\nij\ncomplex) called determinant of the square matrix A, where a = (i, j)th element of A. ij\nReprint 2025-26\nDETERMINANTS 77\nThis may be thought of as a function which associates each square matrix with a\nunique number (real or complex). If M is the set of square matrices, K is the set of\nnumbers (real or complex) and f : M → K is defined by f(A) = k, where A ∈ M and\nk ∈ K, then f(A) is called the determinant of A. It is also denoted by |A| or det A or ∆. a b a b\nIf A =  , then determinant of A is written as |A| = = det (A)\nc d c d\nRemarks\n(i) For matrix A, |A| is read as determinant of A and not modulus of A. (ii) Only square matrices have determinants. 4.2.1 Determinant of a matrix of order one\nLet A = [a] be the matrix of order 1, then determinant of A is defined to be equal to a\n4.2.2 Determinant of a matrix of order two\na a \n11 12\nLet A =   be a matrix of order 2 × 2,\na 21 a 22\nthen the determinant of A is defined as:\ndet (A) =|A| = ∆ = = a a – a a\n11 22 21 12\n2 4\nExample 1 Evaluate . –1 2\n2 4\nSolution We have = 2(2) – 4(–1) = 4 + 4 = 8. –1 2\nx x +1\nExample 2 Evaluate\nx –1 x\nSolution We have\nx x +1\n= x (x) – (x + 1) (x – 1) = x2 – (x2 – 1) = x2 – x2 + 1 = 1\nx –1 x\n4.2.3 Determinant of a matrix of order 3 × 3\nDeterminant of a matrix of order three can be determined by expressing it in terms of\nsecond order determinants. This is known as expansion of a determinant along\na row (or a column).", "There are six ways of expanding a determinant of order\nReprint 2025-26\n78 MATHEMATICS\n3 corresponding to each of three rows (R , R and R ) and three columns (C , C and\n1 2 3 1 2\nC ) giving the same value as shown below. 3\nConsider the determinant of square matrix A = [a ]\nij 3 × 3\na a a\n11 12 13\ni.e., | A | = a a a\n21 22 23\na a a\n31 32 33\nExpansion along first Row (R )\n1\nStep 1 Multiply first element a of R by (–1)(1 + 1) [(–1)sum of suffixes in a ] and with the\n11\n11 1\nsecond order determinant obtained by deleting the elements of first row (R ) and first\n1\ncolumn (C ) of | A | as a lies in R and C ,\n1 11 1 1\na a\n22 23\ni.e., (–1)1 + 1 a\n11 a a\n32 33\nStep 2 Multiply 2nd element a of R by (–1)1 + 2 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a ] and the second\n12\n12 1\norder determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R ) and 2nd column (C )\n1 2\nof | A | as a lies in R and C ,\n12 1 2\na a\n21 23\ni.e., (–1)1 + 2a\n12 a a\n31 33\nStep 3 Multiply third element a of R by (–1)1 + 3 [(–1)sum of suffixes in a ] and the second\n13 1 13\norder determinant obtained by deleting elements of first row (R ) and third column (C )\n1 3\nof | A | as a lies in R and C ,\n13 1 3\na a\n21 22\ni.e., (–1)1 + 3a\n13 a a\n31 32\nStep 4 Now the expansion of determinant of A, that is, | A | written as sum of all three\nterms obtained in steps 1, 2 and 3 above is given by\na a a a\n22 23 + (–1)1+2 a 21 23\ndet A =|A| = (–1)1 + 1 a 11 a a 12 a a\n32 33 31 33\na a\n(–1)1+3a 21 22\n+\n13 a a\n31 32\nor |A| = a (a a – a a ) – a (a a – a a )\n11 22 33 32 23 12 21 33 31 23\n+ a (a a – a a )\n13 21 32 31 22\nReprint 2025-26\nDETERMINANTS 79\n=a a a – a a a – a a a + a a a + a a a\n11 22 33 11 32 23 12 21 33 12 31 23 13 21 32\n– a a a ...

The arrangement of rods was precisely\nthat of the numbers in a determinant.", "The Chinese, therefore, early developed the\nidea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant\nMikami, China, pp 30, 93. Seki Kowa, the greatest of the Japanese Mathematicians of seventeenth\ncentury in his work ‘Kai Fukudai no Ho’ in 1683 showed that he had the idea of\ndeterminants and of their expansion. But he used this device only in eliminating a\nquantity from two equations and not directly in the solution of a set of simultaneous\nlinear equations. T. Hayashi, “The Fakudoi and Determinants in Japanese\nMathematics,” in the proc. of the Tokyo Math. Soc., V. Vendermonde was the first to recognise determinants as independent functions. He may be called the formal founder. Laplace (1772), gave general method of\nexpanding a determinant in terms of its complementary minors. In 1773 Lagrange\ntreated determinants of the second and third orders and used them for purpose\nother than the solution of equations. In 1801, Gauss used determinants in his\ntheory of numbers. The next great contributor was Jacques - Philippe - Marie Binet, (1812) who\nstated the theorem relating to the product of two matrices of m-columns and n-\nrows, which for the special case of m = n reduces to the multiplication theorem. Also on the same day, Cauchy (1812) presented one on the same subject. He\nused the word ‘determinant’ in its present sense. He gave the proof of multiplication\ntheorem more satisfactory than Binet’s. The greatest contributor to the theory was Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi, after\nthis the word determinant received its final acceptance. Reprint 2025-26"]
