What could be the other effects of electric\ncurrent? We know that an electric current-carrying wire behaves like a\nmagnet. Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it.

What does it mean? It means that\nthe electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic\neffect. Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each\nother. Then, what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of\nmoving magnets? In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such\nelectromagnetic effects. We shall also study about electromagnets which\ninvolve the magnetic effect of electric current. Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851)\nHans Christian Oersted, one of the leading scientists of the 19th\ncentury, played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism. In\n1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected\nwhen an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby. Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and\nmagnetism were related phenomena. His research later created\ntechnologies such as the radio, television and fiber optics. The unit of\nmagnetic field strength is named the oersted in his honor.

A compass needle is, in fact, a small bar\nmagnet. The ends of the compass needle point approximately towards\nnorth and south directions. The end pointing towards north is called north\nseeking or north pole. The other end that points towards south is called\nsouth seeking or south pole. Through various activities we have observed\nthat like poles repel, while unlike poles of magnets attract each other. Q U E S T I O N\n? 1. Why does a compass needle get deflected when brought near\na bar magnet?

Iron filings near the bar magnet align\nthemselves along the field lines. The iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown\nFig. 12.2. Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern? What does\nthis pattern demonstrate? The magnet exerts its influence in the region\nsurrounding it. Therefore the iron filings experience a force. The force\nthus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern. The region\nsurrounding a magnet, in which the force of the magnet can be detected,\nis said to have a magnetic field. The lines along which the iron filings\nalign themselves represent magnetic field lines. Are there other ways of obtaining magnetic field lines around a bar\nmagnet? Yes, you can yourself draw the field lines of a bar magnet.

How does\nit behave? The south pole of the needle points towards the north\npole of the magnet. The north pole of the compass is directed\naway from the north pole of the magnet. 196 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nn Mark the position of two ends of the needle. n Now move the needle to a new position\nsuch that its south pole occupies the\nposition previously occupied by its north\npole. n In this way, proceed step by step till you\nreach the south pole of the magnet as\nshown in Fig. 12.3.

FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111122222.....44444\nField lines around a bar magnet\nMagnetic field is a quantity that has both direction and magnitude. The direction of the magnetic field is taken to be the direction in which a\nnorth pole of the compass needle moves inside it. Therefore it is taken\nby convention that the field lines emerge from north pole and merge at\nthe south pole (note the arrows marked on the field lines in Fig. 12.4). Inside the magnet, the direction of field lines is from its south pole to its\nnorth pole. Thus the magnetic field lines are closed curves. The relative strength of the magnetic field is shown by the degree of\ncloseness of the field lines.", "The field is stronger, that is, the force acting\non the pole of another magnet placed is greater where the field lines are\ncrowded (see Fig. 12.4). No two field-lines are found to cross each other. If they did, it would\nmean that at the point of intersection, the compass needle would point\ntowards two directions, which is not possible. 1111122222.....22222 MMMMMAAAAAGGGGGNNNNNEEEEETTTTTIIIIICCCCC FFFFFIIIIIEEEEELLLLLDDDDD DDDDDUUUUUEEEEE TTTTTOOOOO AAAAA CCCCCUUUUURRRRRRRRRREEEEENNNNNTTTTT-----CCCCCAAAAARRRRRRRRRRYYYYYIIIIINNNNNGGGGG\nCCCCCOOOOONNNNNDDDDDUUUUUCCCCCTTTTTOOOOORRRRR\nIn Activity 12.1, we have seen that an electric current through a\nmetallic conductor produces a magnetic field around it.

This would result in\nthe change of the direction of current through the copper wire, that is, from south to\nnorth. n Observe the change in the direction of deflection of the needle.

Does the pattern depend on the shape of the\nconductor? We shall investigate this with an activity. We shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around a\nstraight conductor carrying current. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111122222.....55555\nn Take a battery (12 V), a variable resistance (or a rheostat), an\nammeter (0–5 A), a plug key, connecting wires and a long straight\nthick copper wire. n Insert the thick wire through the centre, normal to the plane of a\nrectangular cardboard.

Check it. What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a\ngiven point if the current in the copper wire is changed? To see this, vary\nthe current in the wire. We find that the deflection in the needle also\nchanges. In fact, if the current is increased, the deflection also increases. It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given\npoint increases as the current through the wire increases. What happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved\naway from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the\nsame? To see this, now place the compass at a farther point from the\nconducting wire (say at point Q). What change do you observe? We see\nthat the deflection in the needle decreases. Thus the magnetic field\nproduced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance\nfrom it increases. From Fig. 12.6, it can be noticed that the concentric\ncircles representing the magnetic field around a current-carrying straight\nwire become larger and larger as we move away from it. 12.2.2 Right-Hand Thumb Rule\nA convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated\nwith a current-carrying conductor is given in Fig. 12.7. Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 199\nReprint 2025-26\nImagine that you are holding a current-carrying straight\nconductor in your right hand such that the thumb points towards\nthe direction of current.", "Then your fingers will wrap around the\nconductor in the direction of the field lines of the magnetic field, as\nshown in Fig. 12.7. This is known as the right-hand thumb rule*.

What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly\nbelow it and at a point directly above it? Solution\nThe current is in the east-west direction. Applying the right-hand\nthumb rule, we get that the magnetic field (at any point below or\nabove the wire) turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire,\nwhen viewed from the east end, and anti-clockwise, when viewed\nfrom the west end. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet. 2. List the properties of magnetic field lines. 3. Why don’t two magnetic field lines intersect each other? 12.2.3 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a\nCircular Loop\nWe have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines\nproduced around a current-carrying straight wire. Suppose\nthis straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a\ncurrent is passed through it. How would the magnetic field\nlines look like? We know that the magnetic field produced\nby a current-carrying straight wire depends inversely on the\ndistance from it. Similarly at every point of a current-carrying\ncircular loop, the concentric circles representing the magnetic\nfield around it would become larger and larger as we move\naway from the wire (Fig. 12.8). By the time we reach at the\ncentre of the circular loop, the arcs of these big circles would\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111122222.....88888 appear as straight lines. Every point on the wire carrying\nMagnetic field lines of the field current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as\nproduced by a current-carrying\nstraight lines at the center of the loop. By applying the right\ncircular loop\nhand rule, it is easy to check that every section of the wire\ncontributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction\nwithin the loop. * This rule is also called Maxwell’s corkscrew rule. If we consider ourselves driving a\ncorkscrew in the direction of the current, then the direction of the rotation of\ncorkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field. 200 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nWe know that the magnetic field produced by a current-carrying\nwire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it. Therefore, if there is a circular coil having n turns, the field produced is\nn times as large as that produced by a single turn. This is because the\ncurrent in each circular turn has the same direction, and the field due to\neach turn then just adds up.

The pattern\nof the magnetic field lines around a current-carrying solenoid is\nshown in Fig. 12.10. Compare the pattern of the field with the\nmagnetic field around a bar magnet (Fig. 12.4). Do they look\nsimilar? Yes, they are similar. In fact, one end of the solenoid\nbehaves as a magnetic north pole, while the other behaves as the\nsouth pole. The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 1111122222.....1111100000\nparallel straight lines. This indicates that the magnetic field is Field lines of the magnetic field\nthrough and around a current\nthe same at all points inside the solenoid.

The field so produced exerts a force on a\nmagnet placed in the vicinity of the conductor. French scientist Andre\nMarie Ampere (1775–1836) suggested that the magnet must also exert\nan equal and opposite force on the current-carrying conductor. The force\ndue to a magnetic field acting on a current-carrying conductor can be\ndemonstrated through the following activity.", "AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 1111122222.....77777\nn Take a small aluminium rod AB (of about 5 cm).

The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a\nforce is exerted on the current-carrying aluminium rod when it is placed\nin a magnetic field. It also suggests that the direction of force is also\nreversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed. Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by\ninterchanging the two poles of the magnet. It is once again observed that\n202 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nthe direction of force acting on the current-carrying rod gets reversed. It\nshows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the\ndirection of current and the direction of the magnetic field. Experiments\nhave shown that the displacement of the rod is largest (or the magnitude\nof the force is the highest) when the direction of current is at right angles\nto the direction of the magnetic field. In such a condition we can use a\nsimple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor. In Activity 12.7, we considered the\ndirection of the current and that of the magnetic\nfield perpendicular to each other and found\nthat the force is perpendicular to both of them. The three directions can be illustrated through\na simple rule, called Fleming’s left-hand rule. According to this rule, stretch the thumb,\nforefinger and middle finger of your left hand\nsuch that they are mutually perpendicular\n(Fig. 12.13).

In our country, the\npotential difference between the two is 220 V. At the meter-board in the house, these wires pass into an electricity\nmeter through a main fuse.

This is used as a safety measure, especially for those appliances that\nhave a metallic body, for example, electric press, toaster, table fan,\nrefrigerator, etc. The metallic body is connected to the earth wire, which\nprovides a low-resistance conducting path for the current.

In each separate circuit, different appliances can be\nconnected across the live and neutral wires. Each appliance has a\nseparate switch to ‘ON’/‘OFF’ the flow of current through it. In order\nthat each appliance has equal potential difference, they are connected\nparallel to each other. Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits. We\nhave already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous\nchapter (see Section 11.7). A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the\nappliances and the circuit due to overloading. Overloading can occur\nwhen the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact. (This\noccurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the\nappliance.) In such a situation, the current in the circuit abruptly\nincreases. This is called short-circuiting. The use of an electric fuse\nprevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage\nby stopping the flow of unduly high electric current. The Joule heating\nthat takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit. Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply\nvoltage. Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many\nappliances to a single socket. Q U E S T I O N S\n1. Name two safety measures commonly used in electric circuits and ? appliances. 2.
