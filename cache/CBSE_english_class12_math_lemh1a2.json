["196 MATHEMATICS\n2\nAppendix\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING\nA.2.1 Introduction\nIn class XI, we have learnt about mathematical modelling as an attempt to study some\npart (or form) of some real-life problems in mathematical terms, i.e., the conversion of\na physical situation into mathematics using some suitable conditions. Roughly speaking\nmathematical modelling is an activity in which we make models to describe the behaviour\nof various phenomenal activities of our interest in many ways using words, drawings or\nsketches, computer programs, mathematical formulae etc. In earlier classes, we have observed that solutions to many problems, involving\napplications of various mathematical concepts, involve mathematical modelling in one\nway or the other. Therefore, it is important to study mathematical modelling as a separate\ntopic. In this chapter, we shall further study mathematical modelling of some real-life\nproblems using techniques/results from matrix, calculus and linear programming. A.2.2 Why Mathematical Modelling? Students are aware of the solution of word problems in arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry\nand linear programming etc. Sometimes we solve the problems without going into the\nphysical insight of the situational problems. Situational problems need physical insight\nthat is introduction of physical laws and some symbols to compare the mathematical\nresults obtained with practical values. To solve many problems faced by us, we need a\ntechnique and this is what is known as mathematical modelling. Let us consider the\nfollowing problems:\n(i) To find the width of a river (particularly, when it is difficult to cross the river). (ii) To find the optimal angle in case of shot-put (by considering the variables\nsuch as : the height of the thrower, resistance of the media, acceleration due to\ngravity etc.). (iii) To find the height of a tower (particularly, when it is not possible to reach the top\nof the tower). (iv) To find the temperature at the surface of the Sun. Reprint 2025-26\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING 197\n(v) Why heart patients are not allowed to use lift? (without knowing the physiology\nof a human being). (vi) To find the mass of the Earth. (vii) Estimate the yield of pulses in India from the standing crops (a person is not\nallowed to cut all of it). (viii) Find the volume of blood inside the body of a person (a person is not allowed to\nbleed completely). (ix) Estimate the population of India in the year 2020 (a person is not allowed to wait\ntill then). All of these problems can be solved and infact have been solved with the help of\nMathematics using mathematical modelling. In fact, you might have studied the methods\nfor solving some of them in the present textbook itself. However, it will be instructive if\nyou first try to solve them yourself and that too without the help of Mathematics, if\npossible, you will then appreciate the power of Mathematics and the need for\nmathematical modelling.", "A.2.3 Principles of Mathematical Modelling\nMathematical modelling is a principled activity and so it has some principles behind it. These principles are almost philosophical in nature. Some of the basic principles of\nmathematical modelling are listed below in terms of instructions:\n(i) Identify the need for the model. (for what we are looking for)\n(ii) List the parameters/variables which are required for the model. (iii) Identify the available relevent data. (what is given?)\n(iv) Identify the circumstances that can be applied (assumptions)\n(v) Identify the governing physical principles. (vi) Identify\n(a) the equations that will be used. (b) the calculations that will be made. (c) the solution which will follow. (vii) Identify tests that can check the\n(a) consistency of the model. (b) utility of the model. (viii) Identify the parameter values that can improve the model. Reprint 2025-26\n198 MATHEMATICS\nThe above principles of mathematical modelling lead to the following: steps for\nmathematical modelling. Step 1: Identify the physical situation. Step 2: Convert the physical situation into a mathematical model by introducing\nparameters / variables and using various known physical laws and symbols. Step 3: Find the solution of the mathematical problem. Step 4: Interpret the result in terms of the original problem and compare the result\nwith observations or experiments. Step 5: If the result is in good agreement, then accept the model. Otherwise modify\nthe hypotheses / assumptions according to the physical situation and go to\nStep 2. The above steps can also be viewed through the following diagram:\nFig A.2.1\nExample 1 Find the height of a given tower using mathematical modelling. Solution Step 1 Given physical situation is “to find the height of a given tower”. Step 2 Let AB be the given tower (Fig A.2.2). Let PQ be an observer measuring the\nheight of the tower with his eye at P. Let PQ = h and let height of tower be H. Let α\nbe the angle of elevation from the eye of the observer to the top of the tower. Fig A.2.2\nReprint 2025-26\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING 199\nLet l =PC = QB\nAC H−h\nNow tanα = =\nPC l\nor H = h + l tan α ... (1)\nStep 3 Note that the values of the parameters h, l and α (using sextant) are known to\nthe observer and so (1) gives the solution of the problem. Step 4 In case, if the foot of the tower is not accessible, i.e., when l is not known to the\nobserver, let β be the angle of depression from P to the foot B of the tower. So from\n∆PQB, we have\nPQ h\ntanβ= = or l = h cot β\nQB l\nStep 5 is not required in this situation as exact values of the parameters h, l, α and β\nare known. Example 2 Let a business firm produces three types of products P , P and P that\n1 2 3\nuses three types of raw materials R , R and R . Let the firm has purchase orders from\n1 2 3\ntwo clients F and F .", "Considering the situation that the firm has a limited quantity of\n1 2\nR , R and R , respectively, prepare a model to determine the quantities of the raw\n1 2 3\nmaterial R , R and R required to meet the purchase orders. 1 2 3\nSolution Step 1 The physical situation is well identified in the problem.

Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture\neach unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the\navailable raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders. Remark If we replace A in Example 3 by A given by\n1\n9 12 6 \nA =  \n1 10 20 0\ni.e., if the clients agree to reduce their purchase orders, then\n3 4 0 \n9 12 6   141 216 78\nA B =   7 9 3  =  \n1 10 20 0 170 220 60\n 5 12 7 \nReprint 2025-26\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING 201\nThis requires 311 units of R , 436 units of R and 138 units of R which are well\n1 2 3\nbelow the available raw materials, i.e., 330 units of R , 455 units of R and 140 units of\n1 2\nR . Thus, if the revised purchase orders of the clients are given by A , then the firm\n3 1\ncan easily supply the purchase orders of the two clients. A\nNote One may further modify A so as to make full use of the available\nraw material. Query Can we make a mathematical model with a given B and with fixed quantities of\nthe available raw material that can help the firm owner to ask the clients to modify their\norders in such a way that the firm makes the full use of its available raw material? The answer to this query is given in the following example:\nExample 4 Suppose P , P , P and R , R , R are as in Example 2.", "Let the firm has\n1 2 3 1 2 3\n330 units of R , 455 units of R and 140 units of R available with it and let the amount\n1 2 3\nof raw materials R , R and R required to manufacture each unit of the three products\n1 2 3\nis given by\nR R R\n1 2 3\nP 3 4 0\n1\n \nB=P 7 9 3\n2 \nP  5 12 7 \n3\nHow many units of each product is to be made so as to utilise the full available raw\nmaterial? Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable. Step 2 Suppose the firm produces x units of P , y units of P and z units of P . Since\n1 2 3\nproduct P requires 3 units of R , P requires 7 units of R and P requires 5 units of R\n1 1 2 1 3 1\n(observe matrix B) and the total number of units, of R , available is 330, we have\n1\n3x + 7y + 5z =330 (for raw material R )\n1\nSimilarly, we have\n4x + 9y + 12z =455 (for raw material R )\n2\nand 3y + 7z =140 (for raw material R )\n3\nThis system of equations can be expressed in matrix form as\n3 7 5  x 330\n     \n4 9 12 y = 455\n     \n 0 3 7    z   140 \nReprint 2025-26\n202 MATHEMATICS\nStep 3 Using elementary row operations, we obtain\n1 0 0 x 20\n     \n0 1 0 y = 35\n     \n 0 0 1   z    5  \nThis gives x = 20, y = 35 and z = 5. Thus, the firm can produce 20 units of P , 35\n1\nunits of P and 5 units of P to make full use of its available raw material. 2 3\nRemark One may observe that if the manufacturer decides to manufacture according\nto the available raw material and not according to the purchase orders of the two\nclients F and F (as in Example 3), he/she is unable to meet these purchase orders as\n1 2\nF demanded 6 units of P where as the manufacturer can make only 5 units of P . 1 3 3\nExample 5 A manufacturer of medicines is preparing a production plan of medicines\nM and M . There are sufficient raw materials available to make 20000 bottles of M\n1 2 1\nand 40000 bottles of M , but there are only 45000 bottles into which either of the\n2\nmedicines can be put. Further, it takes 3 hours to prepare enough material to fill 1000\nbottles of M , it takes 1 hour to prepare enough material to fill 1000 bottles of M and\n1 2\nthere are 66 hours available for this operation. The profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M and\n1\nRs 7 per bottle for M . How should the manufacturer schedule his/her production in\n2\norder to maximise profit? Solution Step 1 To find the number of bottles of M and M in order to maximise the\n1 2\nprofit under the given hypotheses. Step 2 Let x be the number of bottles of type M medicine and y be the number of\n1\nbottles of type M medicine. Since profit is Rs 8 per bottle for M and Rs 7 per bottle\n2 1\nfor M , therefore the objective function (which is to be maximised) is given by\n2\nZ ≡ Z (x, y) = 8x + 7y\nThe objective function is to be maximised subject to the constraints (Refer Chapter\n12 on Linear Programming)\nx≤20000 \n\ny≤40000\n\n\nx+y≤45000 \n ...

Hence, the manufacturer should produce 10500 bottles of\nM medicine and 34500 bottles of M medicine in order to get maximum profit of\n1 2\n`325500. Example 6 Suppose a company plans to produce a new product that incur some costs\n(fixed and variable) and let the company plans to sell the product at a fixed price. Prepare a mathematical model to examine the profitability. Solution Step 1 Situation is clearly identifiable. Reprint 2025-26\n204 MATHEMATICS\nStep 2 Formulation: We are given that the costs are of two types: fixed and variable. The fixed costs are independent of the number of units produced (e.g., rent and rates),\nwhile the variable costs increase with the number of units produced (e.g., material). Initially, we assume that the variable costs are directly proportional to the number of\nunits produced — this should simplify our model. The company earn a certain amount\nof money by selling its products and wants to ensure that it is maximum. For convenience,\nwe assume that all units produced are sold immediately. The mathematical model\nLet x =number of units produced and sold\nC =total cost of production (in rupees)\nI =income from sales (in rupees)\nP = profit (in rupees)\nOur assumptions above state that C consists of two parts:\n(i) fixed cost = a (in rupees),\n(ii) variable cost = b (rupees/unit produced). Then C =a + bx ... (1)\nAlso, income I depends on selling price s (rupees/unit)\nThus I =sx ... (2)\nThe profit P is then the difference between income and costs. So\nP = I – C\n=sx – (a + bx)\n=(s – b) x – a ... (3)\nWe now have a mathematical model of the relationships (1) to (3) between\nthe variables x, C, I, P, a, b, s. These variables may be classified as:\nindependent x\ndependent C, I, P\nparameters a, b, s\nThe manufacturer, knowing x, a, b, s can determine P. Step 3 From (3), we can observe that for the break even point (i.e., make neither profit\na\nnor loss), he must have P = 0, i.e., x= units. s−b\nSteps 4 and 5 In view of the break even point, one may conclude that if the company\na\nproduces few units, i.e., less than x= units, then the company will suffer loss\ns−b\nReprint 2025-26\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING 205\na\nand if it produces large number of units, i.e., much more than units, then it can\ns−b\nmake huge profit. Further, if the break even point proves to be unrealistic, then another\nmodel could be tried or the assumptions regarding cash flow may be modified.", "Remark From (3), we also have\ndP\n=s−b\ndx\nThis means that rate of change of P with respect to x depends on the quantity\ns – b, which is the difference of selling price and the variable cost of each product. Thus, in order to gain profit, this should be positive and to get large gains, we need to\nproduce large quantity of the product and at the same time try to reduce the variable\ncost. Example 7 Let a tank contains 1000 litres of brine which contains 250 g of salt per\nlitre. Brine containing 200 g of salt per litre flows into the tank at the rate of 25 litres per\nminute and the mixture flows out at the same rate. Assume that the mixture is kept\nuniform all the time by stirring. What would be the amount of salt in the tank at\nany time t? Solution Step 1 The situation is easily identifiable. Step 2 Let y = y (t) denote the amount of salt (in kg) in the tank at time t (in minutes)\nafter the inflow, outflow starts. Further assume that y is a differentiable function. When t = 0, i.e., before the inflow–outflow of the brine starts,\ny = 250 g × 1000 = 250 kg\nNote that the change in y occurs due to the inflow, outflow of the mixture. Now the inflow of brine brings salt into the tank at the rate of 5 kg per minute\n(as 25 × 200 g = 5 kg) and the outflow of brine takes salt out of the tank at the rate of\n y  y y\n25    = kg per minute (as at time t, the salt in the tank is kg). 1000 40 1000\nThus, the rate of change of salt with respect to t is given by\ndy y\n= 5− (Why?)\ndt 40\ndy 1\nor + y = 5 ... (1)\ndt 40\nReprint 2025-26\n206 MATHEMATICS\nThis gives a mathematical model for the given problem. Step 3 Equation (1) is a linear equation and can be easily solved. The solution of (1) is\ngiven by\nt t − t\nye40 =200e40 +C or y (t) = 200 + C e 40 ... (2)\nwhere, c is the constant of integration. Note that when t = 0, y = 250. Therefore, 250 = 200 + C\nor C = 50\nThen (2) reduces to\n− t\ny = 200 + 50 e 40 ... (3)\ny−200 − t\nor = e 40\n50\nt 50\nor e40 =\ny−200\n 50 \nTherefore t = 40log   ... (4)\ne  y−200\nHere, the equation (4) gives the time t at which the salt in tank is y kg. − t\nStep 4 Since e 40 is always positive, from (3), we conclude that y > 200 at all times\nThus, the minimum amount of salt content in the tank is 200 kg. Also, from (4), we conclude that t > 0 if and only if 0 < y – 200 < 50 i.e., if and only\nif 200 < y < 250 i.e., the amount of salt content in the tank after the start of inflow and\noutflow of the brine is between 200 kg and 250 kg. Limitations of Mathematical Modelling\nTill today many mathematical models have been developed and applied successfully\nto understand and get an insight into thousands of situations. Some of the subjects like\nmathematical physics, mathematical economics, operations research, bio-mathematics\netc. are almost synonymous with mathematical modelling. But there are still a large number of situations which are yet to be modelled.", "The\nreason behind this is that either the situation are found to be very complex or the\nmathematical models formed are mathematically intractable. Reprint 2025-26\nMATHEMATICAL MODELLING 207\nThe development of the powerful computers and super computers has enabled us\nto mathematically model a large number of situations (even complex situations). Due\nto these fast and advanced computers, it has been possible to prepare more realistic\nmodels which can obtain better agreements with observations. However, we do not have good guidelines for choosing various parameters / variables\nand also for estimating the values of these parameters / variables used in a mathematical\nmodel. Infact, we can prepare reasonably accurate models to fit any data by choosing\nfive or six parameters / variables. We require a minimal number of parameters / variables\nto be able to estimate them accurately. Mathematical modelling of large or complex situations has its own special problems. These type of situations usually occur in the study of world models of environment,\noceanography, pollution control etc. Mathematical modellers from all disciplines —\nmathematics, computer science, physics, engineering, social sciences, etc., are involved\nin meeting these challenges with courage. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
