Such formulae are\nfundamental in the applications of mathematics to many\nreal life problems. The formulae of elementary geometry\nallow us to calculate areas of many simple figures. However, they are inadequate for calculating the areas\nenclosed by curves. For that we shall need some concepts\nof Integral Calculus. In the previous chapter, we have studied to find the\narea bounded by the curve y = f (x), the ordinates x = a,\nx = b and x-axis, while calculating definite integral as the\nlimit of a sum. Here, in this chapter, we shall study a specific\napplication of integrals to find the area under simple curves,\nA.L. Cauchy\narea between lines and arcs of circles, parabolas and\n(1789-1857)\nellipses (standard forms only). We shall also deal with finding\nthe area bounded by the above said curves. 8.2 Area under Simple Curves\nIn the previous chapter, we have studied\ndefinite integral as the limit of a sum and\nhow to evaluate definite integral using\nFundamental Theorem of Calculus. Now,\nwe consider the easy and intuitive way of\nfinding the area bounded by the curve\ny = f(x), x-axis and the ordinates x = a and\nx = b. From Fig 8.1, we can think of area\nunder the curve as composed of large\nnumber of very thin vertical strips. Consider\nan arbitrary strip of height y and width dx,\nthen dA (area of the elementary strip)= ydx,\nwhere, y = f(x). Fig 8.1\nReprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF INTEGRALS 293\nThis area is called the elementary area which is located at an arbitrary position\nwithin the region which is specified by some value of x between a and b. We can think\nof the total area A of the region between x-axis, ordinates x = a, x = b and the curve\ny = f (x) as the result of adding up the elementary areas of thin strips across the region\nPQRSP. Symbolically, we express\nA =\n∫b dA=∫b ydx=∫b\nf(x)dx\na a a\nThe area A of the region bounded by\nthe curve x = g (y), y-axis and the lines y = c,\ny = d is given by\nA = ∫ d xdy=∫ d g(y)dy\nc c\nHere, we consider horizontal strips as shown in\nthe Fig 8.2 Fig 8.2\nRemark If the position of the curve under consideration is below the x-axis, then since\nf(x) < 0 from x = a to x = b, as shown in Fig 8.3, the area bounded by the curve, x-axis\nand the ordinates x = a, x = b come out to be negative. But, it is only the numerical\nvalue of the area which is taken into consideration. Thus, if the area is negative, we\ntake its absolute value, i.e.,\n∫b\nf(x)dx . a\nFig 8.3\nGenerally, it may happen that some portion of the curve is above x-axis and some is\nbelow the x-axis as shown in the Fig 8.4.

This method arose in the solution of problems\non calculating areas of plane figures, surface areas and volumes of solid bodies\netc. In this sense, the method of exhaustion can be regarded as an early method\nReprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF INTEGRALS 299\nof integration. The greatest development of method of exhaustion in the early\nperiod was obtained in the works of Eudoxus (440 B.C.) and Archimedes\n(300 B.C.)\nSystematic approach to the theory of Calculus began in the 17th century. In 1665, Newton began his work on the Calculus described by him as the theory\nof fluxions and used his theory in finding the tangent and radius of curvature at\nany point on a curve. Newton introduced the basic notion of inverse function\ncalled the anti derivative (indefinite integral) or the inverse method of tangents. During 1684-86, Leibnitz published an article in the Acta Eruditorum which\nhe called Calculas summatorius, since it was connected with the summation of\na number of infinitely small areas, whose sum, he indicated by the symbol ‘∫’. In\n1696, he followed a suggestion made by J. Bernoulli and changed this article to\nCalculus integrali. This corresponded to Newton’s inverse method of tangents. Both Newton and Leibnitz adopted quite independent lines of approach which\nwas radically different. However, respective theories accomplished results that\nwere practically identical.", "Leibnitz used the notion of definite integral and what is\nquite certain is that he first clearly appreciated tie up between the antiderivative\nand the definite integral. Conclusively, the fundamental concepts and theory of Integral Calculus and\nprimarily its relationships with Differential Calculus were developed in the work\nof P.de Fermat, I. Newton and G. Leibnitz at the end of 17th century. However,\nthis justification by the concept of limit was only developed in the works of A.L. Cauchy in the early 19th century. Lastly, it is worth mentioning the following\nquotation by Lie Sophie’s:\n“It may be said that the conceptions of differential quotient and integral which\nin their origin certainly go back to Archimedes were introduced in Science by the\ninvestigations of Kepler, Descartes, Cavalieri, Fermat and Wallis .... The discovery\nthat differentiation and integration are inverse operations belongs to Newton\nand Leibnitz”. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
