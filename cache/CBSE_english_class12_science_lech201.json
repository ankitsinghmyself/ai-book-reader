The common names of alkyl halides are derived by\nnaming the alkyl group followed by the name of halide. In the IUPAC system\nof nomenclature, alkyl halides are named as halosubstituted hydrocarbons. For mono halogen substituted derivatives of benzene, common and IUPAC\nnames are the same. For dihalogen derivatives, the prefixes o-, m-, p- are\nused in common system but in IUPAC system, as you have learnt in Class\nXI, the numerals 1,2; 1,3 and 1,4 are used. The dihaloalkanes having the same type of halogen atoms are named\nas alkylidene or alkylene dihalides. The dihalo-compounds having both\nthe halogen atoms are further classified as geminal halides or gem-dihalides\nwhen both the halogen atoms are present on the same carbon atom of the\n161 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nchain and vicinal halides or vic-dihalides when halogen atoms are present\non adjacent carbon atoms. In common name system, gem-dihalides are\nnamed as alkylidene halides and vic-dihalides are named as alkylene\ndihalides. In IUPAC system, they are named as dihaloalkanes.

The order of reactivity of alcohols\nwith a given haloacid is 3°>2°>1°. Phosphorus tribromide and triiodide\nare usually generated in situ (produced in the reaction mixture) by the\nreaction of red phosphorus with bromine and iodine respectively. The preparation of alkyl chloride is carried out either by passing\ndry hydrogen chloride gas through a solution of alcohol or by heating\na mixture of alcohol and concentrated aqueous halogen acid. The above methods are not applicable for the preparation of aryl\nhalides because the carbon-oxygen bond in phenols has a partial double\nbond character and is difficult to break being stronger than a single\nbond. 6.4.2 From (I) From alkanes by free radical halogenation\nHydrocarbons Free radical chlorination or bromination of alkanes gives a complex\nmixture of isomeric mono- and polyhaloalkanes, which is difficult to\nChemistry 164\nReprint 2025-26\nseparate as pure compounds.

Higher members\nare liquids or solids. As we have already learnt, molecules of organic\nhalogen compounds are generally polar. Due to greater polarity as well\nas higher molecular mass as compared to the parent hydrocarbon, the\nintermolecular forces of attraction (dipole-dipole and van der Waals)\nare stronger in the halogen derivatives. That is why the boiling points\nof chlorides, bromides and iodides are considerably higher than those\nof the hydrocarbons of comparable molecular mass. The attractions get stronger as the molecules get bigger in size and\nhave more electrons. The pattern of variation of boiling points of different\nhalides is depicted in Fig. 6.1. For the same alkyl group, the boiling\npoints of alkyl halides decrease in the order: RI> RBr> RCl> RF. This\nis because with the increase in size and mass of halogen atom, the\nmagnitude of van der Waal forces increases. Fig. 6.1: Comparison of boiling points of some alkyl halides\nThe boiling points of isomeric haloalkanes decrease with increase\nin branching. For example, 2-bromo-2-methylpropane has the lowest\nboiling point among the three isomers. Boiling points of isomeric dihalobenzenes are very nearly the same. However, the para-isomers are high melting as compared to their ortho-\nand meta-isomers. It is due to symmetry of para-isomers that fits in\ncrystal lattice better as compared to ortho- and meta-isomers.

In order to dissolve\nhaloalkane in water, energy is required to overcome the attractions between\nthe haloalkane molecules and break the hydrogen bonds between water\nmolecules. Less energy is released when new attractions are set up between\nthe haloalkane and the water molecules as these are not as strong as the\noriginal hydrogen bonds in water. As a result, the solubility of haloalkanes\nin water is low.", "However, haloalkanes tend to dissolve in organic solvents\nbecause the new intermolecular attractions between haloalkanes and\nsolvent molecules have much the same strength as the ones being broken\nin the separate haloalkane and solvent molecules.

Haloalkanes\n(1)Nucleophilic substitution reactions\nYou have learnt in Class XI that nucleophiles are electron rich species. Therefore, they attack at that part of the substrate molecule which\nis electron deficient. The reaction in which a nucleophile replaces\n169 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nalready existing nucleophile in a molecule is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction. Haloalkanes are substrate in these reactions. In this type of reaction, a nucleophile reacts with haloalkane (the\nsubstrate) having a partial positive charge on the carbon atom bonded\nto halogen. A substitution reaction takes place and halogen atom,\ncalled leaving group departs as halide ion. Since the substitution\nreaction is initiated by a nucleophile, it is called nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction. It is one of the most useful classes of organic reactions of alkyl\nhalides in which halogen is bonded to sp3 hybridised carbon. The\nproducts formed by the reaction of haloalkanes with some common\nnucleophiles are given in Table 6.4.

Similarly nitrite ion also represents an ambident\nii\nnucleophile with two different points of linkage [–O—N=O]. The linkage\nthrough oxygen results in alkyl nitrites while through nitrogen atom, it\nleads to nitroalkanes. Mechanism: This reaction has been found to proceed by two different\nmechanims which are described below:\n(a) Substitution nucleophilic bimolecular (S 2)\nN\nThe reaction between CH Cl and hydroxide ion to yield methanol and\n3\nchloride ion follows a second order kinetics, i.e., the rate depends\nupon the concentration of both the reactants. The solid wedge represents the bond coming out of the paper, dashed line going down the\npaper and a straight line representing bond in the plane of the paper. The above reaction can be represented diagrammatically as shown in\nFig. 6.2. Fig. 6.2: Red ball represents the incoming hydroxide ion and green ball represents\nthe outgoing halide ion\nIn the year 1937, It depicts a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution (S 2) reaction;\nN\nEdward Davies Hughes the incoming nucleophile interacts with alkyl halide causing the\nand Sir Christopher\ncarbon-halide bond to break and a new bond is formed between\nIngold proposed a\ncarbon and attacking nucleophile. Here it is C-O bond formed between\nmechanism for an S 2\nreaction. N C and -OH. These two processes take place simultaneously in a\n171 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nsingle step and no intermediate is formed. As the reaction progresses\nand the bond between the incoming nucleophile and the carbon\natom starts forming, the bond between carbon atom and leaving\ngroup weakens. As this happens, the three carbon-hydrogen bonds\nof the substrate start moving away from the attacking nucleophile. In\ntransition state all the three C-H bonds are in the same plane and the\nattacking and leaving nucleophiles are partially attached to the\ncarbon. As the attacking nucleophile approaches closer to the carbon,\nC-H bonds still keep on moving in the same direction till the attacking\nnucleophile attaches to carbon and leaving group leaves the carbon. As a result configuration is inverted, the configuration (See box) of\ncarbon atom under attack inverts in much the same way as an\numbrella is turned inside out when caught in a strong wind. This\nprocess is called as inversion of configuration. In the transition\nstate, the carbon atom is simultaneously bonded to incoming\nnucleophile and the outgoing leaving group. Such structures are\nunstable and cannot be isolated.", "Thus, in the transition state, carbon\nis simultaneously bonded to five atoms. Configuration\nSpacial arrangement of functional groups around carbon is called its configuration. See the structures (A) and (B) given below carefully. These are the two structures of the same compound. They differ in spacial arrangement\nof functional groups attached to carbon. Structure (A) is mirror image of Structure (B). We say configuration of carbon in structure (A) is mirror image of the configuration of\ncarbon in structure (B).

Of the\nUniversity of London. simple alkyl halides, methyl halides react most rapidly in S 2 reactions\nN\nbecause there are only three small hydrogen atoms. Tertiary halides\nare the least reactive because bulky groups hinder the approaching\nChemistry 172\nReprint 2025-26\nnucleophiles. Thus the order of reactivity followed is:\nPrimary halide > Secondary halide > Tertiary halide. Fig.6.3: Steric effects in S 2 reaction. The relative rate of S 2 reaction is given in parenthesis\nN N\n(b) Substitution nucleophilic unimolecular (S 1)\nN\nS 1 reactions are generally carried out in polar protic solvents\nN\n(like water, alcohol, acetic acid, etc.). The reaction between tert-\nbutyl bromide and hydroxide ion yields tert-butyl alcohol and\nfollows the first order kinetics, i.e., the rate of reaction depends\nupon the concentration of only one reactant, which is tert- butyl\nbromide. It occurs in two steps. In step I, the polarised C—Br bond undergoes\nslow cleavage to produce a carbocation and a bromide ion. The\ncarbocation thus formed is then attacked by nucleophile in step II\nto complete the substitution reaction. 173 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nStep I is the slowest and reversible. It involves the C–Br bond breaking for which the\nenergy is obtained through solvation of halide ion with the proton of protic solvent. Since\nthe rate of reaction depends upon the slowest step, the rate of reaction depends only on the\nconcentration of alkyl halide and not on the concentration of hydroxide ion. Further, greater\nthe stability of carbocation, greater will be its ease of formation from alkyl halide and faster\nwill be the rate of reaction. In case of alkyl halides, 30 alkyl halides undergo S 1 reaction\nN\nvery fast because of the high stability of 30 carbocations. We can sum up the order of reactivity\nof alkyl halides towards S 1 and S 2 reactions as follows:\nN N\nFor the same reasons, allylic and benzylic halides show high reactivity towards the S 1\nN\nreaction.", "The carbocation thus formed gets stabilised through resonance (Unit 8, Class XI) as\nshown below:\n+ +\nH C C CH H C C CH\n2 H 2 2 H 2\nFor a given alkyl group, the reactivity of the halide, R-X, follows the same order in both the\nmechanisms R–I> R–Br>R–Cl>>R–F.

(i) Optical activity: Plane of plane polarised light produced by\npassing ordinary light through Nicol prism is rotated when it\nis passed through the solutions of certain compounds. Such\ncompounds are called optically active compounds.", "The angle\nWilliam Nicol (1768- by which the plane polarised light is rotated is measured by an\n1851) developed the first instrument called polarimeter. If the compound rotates the plane\nprism that produced of plane polarised light to the right, i.e., clockwise direction, it\nplane polarised light. is called dextrorotatory (Greek for right rotating) or the d-form\nand is indicated by placing a positive (+) sign before the degree\nof rotation. If the light is rotated towards left (anticlockwise\ndirection), the compound is said to be laevo-rotatory or the\nl-form and a negative (–) sign is placed before the degree of\nrotation. Such (+) and (–) isomers of a compound are called\noptical isomers and the phenomenon is termed as optical\nisomerism. (ii) Molecular asymmetry, chirality and enantiomers: The\nobservation of Louis Pasteur (1848) that crystals of certain\ncompounds exist in the form of mirror images laid the\nfoundation of modern stereochemistry. He demonstrated that\naqueous solutions of both types of crystals showed optical\nrotation, equal in magnitude (for solution of equal concentration)\nbut opposite in direction. He believed that this difference in\noptical activity was associated with the three dimensional\narrangements of atoms in the molecules (configurations) of\n175 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\ntwo types of crystals. Dutch scientist, J. Van’t Hoff and French\nscientist, C. Le Bel in the same year (1874), independently\nargued that the spatial arrangement of four groups (valencies)\nJacobus Hendricus\naround a central carbon is tetrahedral and if all the substituents\nVan’t Hoff (1852-1911)\nattached to that carbon are different, the mirror image of the\nreceived the first Nobel\nmolecule is not superimposed (overlapped) on the molecule;\nPrize in Chemistry in\n1901 for his work on such a carbon is called asymmetric carbon or stereocentre. solutions. The resulting molecule would lack symmetry and is referred to\nas asymmetric molecule. The asymmetry of the molecule along\nwith non superimposability of mirror images is responsible for\nthe optical activity in such organic compounds. The symmetry and asymmetry are also observed in many day to day\nobjects: a sphere, a cube, a cone, are all identical to\ntheir mirror images and can be superimposed. However, many objects are non superimposable on\ntheir mirror images. For example, your left and right\nhand look similar but if you put your left hand on\nyour right hand by moving them in the same plane,\nthey do not coincide. The objects which are non-\nsuperimposable on their mirror image (like a pair\nof hands) are said to be chiral and this property is\nknown as chirality. Chiral molecules are optically\nactive, while the objects, which are, superimposable\non their mirror images are called achiral. These\nmolecules are optically inactive.", "The above test of molecular chirality can be\napplied to organic molecules by constructing\nmodels and its mirror images or by drawing three\ndimensional structures and attempting to\nsuperimpose them in our minds. There are other\naids, however, that can assist us in recognising\nchiral molecules. One such aid is the presence of\nFig 6.4: Some common examples of chiral and\na single asymmetric carbon atom. Let us consider\nachiral objects\ntwo simple molecules propan-2-ol (Fig.6.5) and butan-2-ol (Fig.6.6)\nand their mirror images. Fig 6.5: B is mirror image of A; B is rotated by 180o and C is\nobtained; C is superimposable on A. As you can see very clearly, propan-2-ol (A) does not contain an asymmetric\ncarbon, as all the four groups attached to the tetrahedral carbon are not\ndifferent. We rotate the mirror image (B) of the molecule by 180° (structure\nC) and try to overlap the structure (C) with the structure (A), these structures\ncompletely overlap. Thus propan-2-ol is an achiral molecule. Chemistry 176\nReprint 2025-26\nFig 6.6: E is mirror image of D; E is rotated by 180o to get F and F is\nnon superimposable on its mirror image D. Butan-2-ol has four different groups attached to\nthe tetrahedral carbon and as expected is chiral. Some common\nexamples of chiral molecules such as\n2-chlorobutane, 2, 3-dihyroxypropanal, (OHC–CHOH–CH OH),\n2\nbromochloro-iodomethane (BrClCHI),2-bromopropanoic acid\n(H C–CHBr–COOH), etc. 3\nFig. 6.7: A chiral molecule The stereoisomers related to each other as non-\nand its mirror image superimposable mirror images are called enantiomers\n(Fig. 6.7). A and B in Fig. 6.5 and D and E in Fig. 6.6 are\nenantiomers. Enantiomers possess identical physical properties namely,\nmelting point, boiling point, refractive index, etc. They only differ\nwith respect to the rotation of plane polarised light. If one of the\nenantiomer is dextro rotatory, the other will be laevo rotatory. However, the sign of optical rotation is not necessarily related to\nthe absolute (actual) configuration of the molecule. A mixture containing two enantiomers in equal proportions\nwill have zero optical rotation, as the rotation due to one isomer\nwill be cancelled by the rotation due to the other isomer. Such\na mixture is known as racemic mixture or racemic\nmodification. A racemic mixture is represented by prefixing dl\nor (–) before the name, for example (–) butan-2-ol. The process\nof conversion of enantiomer into a racemic mixture is known as\nracemisation.

Such a reaction is said\nto proceed with retention of the configuration. Consider as an\nexample, the reaction that takes place when (–)-2-methylbutan-1-ol\nis heated with concentrated hydrochloric acid. It is important to note that configuration at a symmetric centre in\nthe reactant and product is same but the sign of optical rotation\nhas changed in the product. This is so because two different\ncompounds with same configuration at asymmetric centre may have\ndifferent optical rotation. One may be dextrorotatory (plus sign of\noptical rotation) while other may be laevorotatory (negative sign of\noptical rotation). (iv) Inversion, retention and racemisation: There are three outcomes\nfor a reaction at an asymmetric carbon atom, when a bond directly\nlinked to an asymmetric carbon atom is broken. Consider the\nreplacement of a group X by Y in the following reaction;\nIf (A) is the only compound obtained, the process is called retention\nof configuration. Note that configuration has been rotated in A. If (B) is the only compound obtained, the process is called inversion\nof configuration. Configuration has been inverted in B. Chemistry 178\nReprint 2025-26\nIf a 50:50 mixture of A and B is obtained then the process is called\nracemisation and the product is optically inactive, as one isomer will\nrotate the plane polarised light in the direction opposite to another. Now let us have a fresh look at S 1 and S 2 mechanisms by\nN N\ntaking examples of optically active alkyl halides. In case of optically active alkyl halides, the product formed as a\nresult of S 2 mechanism has the inverted configuration as compared\nN\nto the reactant. This is because the nucleophile attaches itself on the\nside opposite to the one where the halogen atom is present. When\n(–)-2-bromooctane is allowed to react with sodium hydroxide,\n(+)-octan-2-ol is formed with the –OH group occupying the position\nopposite to what bromide had occupied. Thus, S 2 reactions of optically active halides are accompanied by\nN\ninversion of configuration. In case of optically active alkyl halides, S 1 reactions are\nN\naccompanied by racemisation. Can you think of the reason why it\nhappens? Actually the carbocation formed in the slow step being sp2\nhybridised is planar (achiral). The attack of the nucleophile may be\naccomplished from either side of the plane of carbocation resulting in\na mixture of products, one having the same configuration (the –OH\nattaching on the same position as halide ion) and the other having\nLocation of aaaaa and opposite configuration (the –OH attaching on the side opposite to halide\nbbbbb carbon in a ion). This may be illustrated by hydrolysis of optically active\nmolecule 2-bromobutane, which results in the formation of (–)-butan-2-ol. Carbon on which 2.", "Elimination reactions\nhalogen atom is When a haloalkane with b-hydrogen atom is heated with alcoholic\ndirectly attached is solution of potassium hydroxide, there is elimination of hydrogen\ncalled a-carbon and atom from b-carbon and a halogen atom from the a-carbon atom. the carbon atom\nadjacent to this\ncarbon is called\nb-carbon. 179 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nAs a result, an alkene is formed as a product. Since b-hydrogen\natom is involved in elimination, it is often called bbbbb-elimination. If there is possibility of formation of more than one alkene due to\nthe availability of more than one b-hydrogen atoms, usually one alkene\nis formed as the major product. These form part of a pattern first\nobserved by Russian chemist, Alexander Zaitsev (also pronounced as\nSaytzeff) who in 1875 formulated a rule which can be summarised as\n“in dehydrohalogenation reactions, the preferred product is that\nalkene which has the greater number of alkyl groups attached to the\ndoubly bonded carbon atoms.” Thus, 2-bromopentane gives\npent-2-ene as the major product.

A collection of molecules tend to do, by and large, what is easiest for them. An\nalkyl halide with b-hydrogen atoms when reacted with a base or a nucleophile has two\ncompeting routes: substitution (S 1 and S 2) and elimination. Which route will be taken\nN N\nup depends upon the nature of alkyl halide, strength and size of base/nucleophile and\nreaction conditions. Thus, a bulkier nucleophile will prefer to act as a base and abstracts\na proton rather than approach a tetravalent carbon atom (steric reasons) and vice versa. Similarly, a primary alkyl halide will prefer a S 2 reaction, a secondary halide- S 2 or\nN N\nelimination depending upon the strength of base/nucleophile and a tertiary halide- S 1 or\nN\nelimination depending upon the stability of carbocation or the more substituted alkene. 3.Reaction with metals\nMost organic chlorides, bromides and iodides react with certain\nmetals to give compounds containing carbon-metal bonds. Such\ncompounds are known as organo-metallic compounds. An\nimportant class of organo-metallic compounds discovered by Victor\nGrignard in 1900 is alkyl magnesium halide, RMgX, referred as\nGrignard Reagents. These reagents are obtained by the reaction of\nhaloalkanes with magnesium metal in dry ether. Chemistry 180\nReprint 2025-26\nVictor Grignard had a strange start in academic life for a chemist - he\ntook a maths degree. When he eventually switched to chemistry, it was\nnot to the mathematical province of physical chemistry but to organic\nchemistry.", "While attempting to find an efficient catalyst for the process\nof methylation, he noted that Zn in diethyl ether had been used for this\npurpose and wondered whether the Mg/ether combination might be\nsuccessful. Grignard reagents were first reported in 1900 and Grignard\nused this work for his doctoral thesis in 1901. In 1910, Grignard obtained\na professorship at the University of Nancy and in 1912, he was awarded\nthe Nobel prize for Chemistry which he shared with Paul Sabatier who\nhad made advances in nickel catalysed hydrogenation. In the Grignard reagent, the carbon-magnesium bond is covalent\nbut highly polar, with carbon pulling electrons from electropositive\nmagnesium; the magnesium halogen bond is essentially ionic. Grignard reagents are highly reactive and react with any source of\nproton to give hydrocarbons. Even water, alcohols, amines are sufficiently\nacidic to convert them to corresponding hydrocarbons. It is therefore necessary to avoid even traces of moisture from a Grignard\nreagent. That is why reaction is carried out in dry ether. On the other\nhand, this could be considered as one of the methods for converting\nhalides to hydrocarbons. Wurtz reaction\nAlkyl halides react with sodium in dry ether to give hydrocarbons\ncontaining double the number of carbon atoms present in the halide. This reaction is known as Wurtz reaction. 6.7.2 Reactionsof\n1. Nucleophilic substitution\nHaloarenes\nAryl halides are extremely less reactive towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reactions due to the following reasons:\n(i) Resonance effect : In haloarenes, the electron pairs on halogen\natom are in conjugation with p-electrons of the ring and the\nfollowing resonating structures are possible. C—Cl bond acquires a partial double bond character due to\nresonance. As a result, the bond cleavage in haloarene is difficult\nthan haloalkane and therefore, they are less reactive towards\nnucleophilic substitution reaction. 181 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Difference in hybridisation of carbon atom in C—X bond: In\nhaloalkane, the carbon atom attached to halogen is sp3\nhybridised while in case of haloarene, the carbon atom attached\nto halogen is sp2-hybridised. The sp2 hybridised carbon with a greater s-character is more\nelectronegative and can hold the electron pair of C—X bond\nmore tightly than sp3-hybridised carbon in haloalkane with\nless s-chararcter. Thus, C—Cl bond length in haloalkane is\n177pm while in haloarene is 169 pm. Since it is difficult to\nbreak a shorter bond than a longer bond, therefore, haloarenes\nare less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic\nsubstitution reaction. (iii) Instability of phenyl cation: In case of haloarenes, the phenyl\ncation formed as a result of self-ionisation will not be stabilised\nby resonance and therefore, S 1 mechanism is ruled out. N\n(iv) Because of the possible repulsion, it is less likely for the electron\nrich nucleophile to approach electron rich arenes.", "Replacement by hydroxyl group\nChlorobenzene can be converted into phenol by heating in aqueous\nsodium hydroxide solution at a temperature of 623K and a pressure\nof 300 atmospheres. The presence of an electron withdrawing group (-NO ) at ortho- and\n2\npara-positions increases the reactivity of haloarenes. Chemistry 182\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect is pronounced when (-NO ) group is introduced at ortho-\n2\nand para- positions. However, no effect on reactivity of haloarenes is\nobserved by the presence of electron withdrawing group at meta-position. Mechanism of the reaction is as depicted:\nCan you think why does NO group show its effect only at ortho- and para- positions\n2\nand not at meta- position? As shown, the presence of nitro group at ortho- and para-positions withdraws the\nelectron density from the benzene ring and thus facilitates the attack of the nucleophile\non haloarene. The carbanion thus formed is stabilised through resonance. The negative\ncharge appeared at ortho- and para- positions with respect to the halogen substituent is\nstabilised by –NO group while in case of meta-nitrobenzene, none of the resonating\n2\nstructures bear the negative charge on carbon atom bearing the –NO group. Therefore,\n2\nthe presence of nitro group at meta- position does not stabilise the negative charge and\nno effect on reactivity is observed by the presence of –NO group at meta-position. 2\n183 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n2. Electrophilic substitution reactions\nHaloarenes undergo the usual electrophilic reactions of the benzene\nring such as halogenation, nitration, sulphonation and Friedel-Crafts\nreactions. Halogen atom besides being slightly deactivating is o, p-\ndirecting; therefore, further substitution occurs at ortho- and para-\npositions with respect to the halogen atom. The o, p-directing influence\nof halogen atom can be easily understood if we consider the resonating\nstructures of halobenzene as shown:\nDue to resonance, the electron density increases more at ortho- and\npara-positions than at meta-positions. Further, the halogen atom\nbecause of its –I effect has some tendency to withdraw electrons from\nthe benzene ring. As a result, the ring gets somewhat deactivated as\ncompared to benzene and hence the electrophilic substitution reactions\nin haloarenes occur slowly and require more drastic conditions as\ncompared to those in benzene.

Through inductive effect, chlorine\ndestabilises the intermediate carbocation formed during the electrophilic\nsubstitution.", "Through resonance, halogen tends to stabilise the carbocation and\nthe effect is more pronounced at ortho- and para- positions. The\ninductive effect is stronger than resonance and causes net electron\nwithdrawal and thus causes net deactivation. The resonance effect\ntends to oppose the inductive effect for the attack at ortho- and para-\npositions and hence makes the deactivation less for ortho- and para-\nattack. Reactivity is thus controlled by the stronger inductive effect\nand orientation is controlled by resonance effect. 185 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\n3.

Some polyhalogen compounds are\ndescribed in this section. 6.8.1 Dichloro- Dichloromethane is widely used as a solvent as a paint remover, as a\nmethane propellant in aerosols, and as a process solvent in the manufacture of\n(Methylene drugs. It is also used as a metal cleaning and finishing solvent. Methylene\nchloride) chloride harms the human central nervous system. Exposure to lower\nlevels of methylene chloride in air can lead to slightly impaired hearing\nand vision. Higher levels of methylene chloride in air cause dizziness,\nnausea, tingling and numbness in the fingers and toes. In humans, direct\nskin contact with methylene chloride causes intense burning and mild\nredness of the skin. Direct contact with the eyes can burn the cornea. 6.8.2 Trichloro- Chemically, chloroform is employed as a solvent for fats, alkaloids,\nmethane iodine and other substances. The major use of chloroform today is in\n(Chloroform) the production of the freon refrigerant R-22. It was once used as a\ngeneral anaesthetic in surgery but has been replaced by less toxic,\nsafer anaesthetics, such as ether. As might be expected from its use as\nan anaesthetic, inhaling chloroform vapours depresses the central\nnervous system. Breathing about 900 parts of chloroform per million\nparts of air (900 parts per million) for a short time can cause dizziness,\nfatigue, and headache.", "Chronic chloroform exposure may cause damage\nto the liver (where chloroform is metabolised to phosgene) and to the\nkidneys, and some people develop sores when the skin is immersed in\nchloroform. Chloroform is slowly oxidised by air in the presence of\nlight to an extremely poisonous gas, carbonyl chloride, also known as\nphosgene. It is therefore stored in closed dark coloured bottles\ncompletely filled so that air is kept out. 6.8.3 Triiodo- It was used earlier as an antiseptic but the antiseptic properties are\nmethane due to the liberation of free iodine and not due to iodoform itself. Due\n(Iodoform) to its objectionable smell, it has been replaced by other formulations\ncontaining iodine. 6.8.4 Tetrachlo- It is produced in large quantities for use in the manufacture of\nromethane refrigerants and propellants for aerosol cans. It is also used as\n(Carbon feedstock in the synthesis of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals,\ntetrachloride) pharmaceutical manufacturing, and general solvent use. Until the mid\n1960s, it was also widely used as a cleaning fluid, both in industry,\nas a degreasing agent, and in the home, as a spot remover and as fire\nextinguisher. There is some evidence that exposure to carbon\ntetrachloride causes liver cancer in humans. The most common effects\nare dizziness, light headedness, nausea and vomiting, which can cause\npermanent damage to nerve cells. In severe cases, these effects can lead\nrapidly to stupor, coma, unconsciousness or death. Exposure to CCl\n4\ncan make the heart beat irregularly or stop. The chemical may irritate\nthe eyes on contact. When carbon tetrachloride is released into the air,\nit rises to the atmosphere and depletes the ozone layer. Depletion of the\n187 Haloalkanes and Haloarenes\nReprint 2025-26\nozone layer is believed to increase human exposure to ultraviolet rays,\nleading to increased skin cancer, eye diseases and disorders, and\npossible disruption of the immune system. 6.8.5 Freons The chlorofluorocarbon compounds of methane and ethane are collectively\nknown as freons. They are extremely stable, unreactive, non-toxic, non-\ncorrosive and easily liquefiable gases. Freon 12 (CCl F ) is one of the\n2 2\nmost common freons in industrial use. It is manufactured from\ntetrachloromethane by Swarts reaction. These are usually produced\nfor aerosol propellants, refrigeration and air conditioning purposes. By\n1974, total freon production in the world was about 2 billion pounds\nannually. Most freon, even that used in refrigeration, eventually makes\nits way into the atmosphere where it diffuses unchanged into the\nstratosphere. In stratosphere, freon is able to initiate radical chain\nreactions that can upset the natural ozone balance. 6.8.6 p,p’-Dichlo- DDT, the first chlorinated organic insecticides, was originally prepared\nrodiphenyl- in 1873, but it was not until 1939 that Paul Muller of Geigy\ntrichloro- Pharmaceuticals in Switzerland discovered the effectiveness of DDT as\nethane(DDT) an insecticide.", "Paul Muller was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine\nand Physiology in 1948 for this discovery. The use of DDT increased\nenormously on a worldwide basis after World War II, primarily because\nof its effectiveness against the mosquito that spreads malaria and lice\nthat carry typhus. However, problems related to extensive use of DDT\nbegan to appear in the late 1940s. Many species of insects developed\nresistance to DDT, and it was also discovered to have a high toxicity\ntowards fish. The chemical stability of DDT and its fat solubility\ncompounded the problem. DDT is not metabolised very rapidly by\nanimals; instead, it is deposited and stored in the fatty tissues. If\ningestion continues at a steady rate, DDT builds up within the animal\nover time. The use of DDT was banned in the United States in 1973,\nalthough it is still in use in some other parts of the world. SSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAlkyl/ Aryl halides may be classified as mono, di, or polyhalogen (tri-, tetra-, etc.)\ncompounds depending on whether they contain one, two or more halogen atoms in\ntheir structures. Since halogen atoms are more electronegative than carbon, the carbon-\nhalogen bond of alkyl halide is polarised; the carbon atom bears a partial positive\ncharge, and the halogen atom bears a partial negative charge. Alkyl halides are prepared by the free radical halogenation of alkanes, addition\nof halogen acids to alkenes, replacement of –OH group of alcohols with halogens using\nChemistry 188\nReprint 2025-26\nphosphorus halides, thionyl chloride or halogen acids. Aryl halides are prepared by\nelectrophilic substitution to arenes. Fluorides and iodides are best prepared by halogen\nexchange method. The boiling points of organohalogen compounds are comparatively higher than the\ncorresponding hydrocarbons because of strong dipole-dipole and van der Waals forces\nof attraction. These are slightly soluble in water but completely soluble in organic\nsolvents. The polarity of carbon-halogen bond of alkyl halides is responsible for their\nnucleophilic substitution, elimination and their reaction with metal atoms to form\norganometallic compounds. Nucleophilic substitution reactions are categorised into\nS 1 and S 2 on the basis of their kinetic properties. Chirality has a profound role in\nN N\nunderstanding the reaction mechanisms of S 1 and S 2 reactions.
