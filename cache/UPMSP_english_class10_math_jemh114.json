["202 MATHEMATICS\n14\nP\nROBABILITY\nThe theory of probabilities and the theory of errors now constitute\na formidable body of great mathematical interest and of great\npractical importance. – R.S. Woodward\n14.1 Probability — A Theoretical Approach\nLet us consider the following situation :\nSuppose a coin is tossed at random. When we speak of a coin, we assume it to be ‘fair’, that is, it is symmetrical so\nthat there is no reason for it to come down more often on one side than the other. We call this property of the coin as being ‘unbiased’. By the phrase ‘random toss’,\nwe mean that the coin is allowed to fall freely without any bias or interference. We know, in advance, that the coin can only land in one of two possible ways —\neither head up or tail up (we dismiss the possibility of its ‘landing’ on its edge, which\nmay be possible, for example, if it falls on sand). We can reasonably assume that each\noutcome, head or tail, is as likely to occur as the other. We refer to this by saying that\nthe outcomes head and tail, are equally likely. For another example of equally likely outcomes, suppose we throw a die\nonce. For us, a die will always mean a fair die. What are the possible outcomes? They are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Each number has the same possibility of showing up. So\nthe equally likely outcomes of throwing a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Reprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 203\nAre the outcomes of every experiment equally likely? Let us see. Suppose that a bag contains 4 red balls and 1 blue ball, and you draw a ball\nwithout looking into the bag. What are the outcomes? Are the outcomes — a red ball\nand a blue ball equally likely? Since there are 4 red balls and only one blue ball, you\nwould agree that you are more likely to get a red ball than a blue ball. So, the outcomes\n(a red ball or a blue ball) are not equally likely. However, the outcome of drawing a\nball of any colour from the bag is equally likely. So, all experiments do not necessarily\nhave equally likely outcomes. However, in this chapter, from now on, we will assume that all the experiments\nhave equally likely outcomes. In Class IX, we defined the experimental or empirical probability P(E) of an\nevent E as\nNumber of trialsin which theevent happened\nP(E) =\nTotal number of trials\nThe empirical interpretation of probability can be applied to every event associated\nwith an experiment which can be repeated a large number of times. The requirement\nof repeating an experiment has some limitations, as it may be very expensive or\nunfeasible in many situations. Of course, it worked well in coin tossing or die throwing\nexperiments. But how about repeating the experiment of launching a satellite in order\nto compute the empirical probability of its failure during launching, or the repetition of\nthe phenomenon of an earthquake to compute the empirical probability of a multi-\nstoreyed building getting destroyed in an earthquake?", "In experiments where we are prepared to make certain assumptions, the repetition\nof an experiment can be avoided, as the assumptions help in directly calculating the\nexact (theoretical) probability. The assumption of equally likely outcomes (which is\nvalid in many experiments, as in the two examples above, of a coin and of a die) is one\nsuch assumption that leads us to the following definition of probability of an event. The theoretical probability (also called classical probability) of an event E,\nwritten as P(E), is defined as\nNumberof outcomesfavourabletoE\nP(E) = ,\nNumberof allpossibleoutcomesof theexperiment\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely. We will briefly refer to theoretical probability as probability. This definition of probability was given by Pierre Simon Laplace in 1795. Reprint 2025-26\n204 MATHEMATICS\nProbability theory had its origin in the 16th century when\nan Italian physician and mathematician J.Cardan wrote the\nfirst book on the subject, The Book on Games of Chance. Since its inception, the study of probability has attracted\nthe attention of great mathematicians. James Bernoulli\n(1654 – 1705), A. de Moivre (1667 – 1754), and\nPierre Simon Laplace are among those who made significant\ncontributions to this field. Laplace’s Theorie Analytique\ndes Probabilités, 1812, is considered to be the greatest\ncontribution by a single person to the theory of probability. Pierre Simon Laplace\nIn recent years, probability has been used extensively in (1749 – 1827)\nmany areas such as biology, economics, genetics, physics,\nsociology etc. Let us find the probability for some of the events associated with experiments\nwhere the equally likely assumption holds. Example 1 : Find the probability of getting a head when a coin is tossed once. Also\nfind the probability of getting a tail. Solution : In the experiment of tossing a coin once, the number of possible outcomes\nis two — Head (H) and Tail (T). Let E be the event ‘getting a head’. The number of\noutcomes favourable to E, (i.e., of getting a head) is 1. Therefore,\nNumber of outcomes favourable to E 1\nP(E) = P (head) = =\nNumber of allpossibleoutcomes 2\nSimilarly, if F is the event ‘getting a tail’, then\n1\nP(F) = P(tail) = (Why ?)\n2\nExample 2 : A bag contains a red ball, a blue ball and a yellow ball, all the balls being\nof the same size. Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. What is\nthe probability that she takes out the\n(i) yellow ball? (ii) red ball? (iii) blue ball? Solution : Kritika takes out a ball from the bag without looking into it. So, it is equally\nlikely that she takes out any one of them. Reprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 205\nLet Y be the event ‘the ball taken out is yellow’, B be the event ‘the ball taken\nout is blue’, and R be the event ‘the ball taken out is red’. Now, the number of possible outcomes = 3. (i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event Y = 1.", "1\nSo, P(Y) =\n3\n1 1\nSimilarly, (ii) P(R) = and (iii) P(B) = \n3 3\nRemarks :\n1. An event having only one outcome of the experiment is called an elementary\nevent. In Example 1, both the events E and F are elementary events. Similarly, in\nExample 2, all the three events, Y, B and R are elementary events. 2. In Example 1, we note that : P(E) + P(F) = 1\nIn Example 2, we note that : P(Y) + P(R) + P(B) = 1\nObserve that the sum of the probabilities of all the elementary events of\nan experiment is 1. This is true in general also. Example 3 : Suppose we throw a die once. (i) What is the probability of getting a\nnumber greater than 4 ? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than or\nequal to 4 ? Solution : (i) Here, let E be the event ‘getting a number greater than 4’. The number\nof possible outcomes is six : 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, and the outcomes favourable to E are 5\nand 6. Therefore, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 2. So,\n2 1\nP(E) = P(number greater than 4) = =\n6 3\n(ii) Let F be the event ‘getting a number less than or equal to 4’. Number of possible outcomes = 6\nOutcomes favourable to the event F are 1, 2, 3, 4. So, the number of outcomes favourable to F is 4. 4 2\nTherefore, P(F) = =\n6 3\nReprint 2025-26\n206 MATHEMATICS\nAre the events E and F in the example above elementary events? No, they are\nnot because the event E has 2 outcomes and the event F has 4 outcomes. Remarks : From Example 1, we note that\n1 1\nP(E) + P(F) =  1 (1)\n2 2\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a head’ and F is the event ‘getting a tail’. From (i) and (ii) of Example 3, we also get\n1 2\nP(E) + P(F) =  1 (2)\n3 3\nwhere E is the event ‘getting a number >4’ and F is the event ‘getting a number  4’. Note that getting a number not greater than 4 is same as getting a number less\nthan or equal to 4, and vice versa. In (1) and (2) above, is F not the same as ‘not E’? Yes, it is. We denote the event\n‘not E’ by E. So, P(E) + P(not E) = 1\ni.e., P(E) + P(E) = 1, which gives us P(E) = 1 – P(E). In general, it is true that for an event E,\nP(E) = 1 – P(E)\nThe event E, representing ‘not E’, is called the complement of the event E. We also say that E and E are complementary events. Before proceeding further, let us try to find the answers to the following questions:\n(i) What is the probability of getting a number 8 in a single throw of a die? (ii) What is the probability of getting a number less than 7 in a single throw of a die? Let us answer (i) :\nWe know that there are only six possible outcomes in a single throw of a die. These\noutcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Since no face of the die is marked 8, so there is no\noutcome favourable to 8, i.e., the number of such outcomes is zero. In other words,\ngetting 8 in a single throw of a die, is impossible. 0\nSo, P(getting 8) = = 0\n6\nReprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 207\nThat is, the probability of an event which is impossible to occur is 0. Such an\nevent is called an impossible event.", "Let us answer (ii) :\nSince every face of a die is marked with a number less than 7, it is sure that we\nwill always get a number less than 7 when it is thrown once. So, the number of\nfavourable outcomes is the same as the number of all possible outcomes, which is 6. 6\nTherefore, P(E) = P(getting a number less than 7) = = 1\n6\nSo, the probability of an event which is sure (or certain) to occur is 1. Such an event\nis called a sure event or a certain event. Note : From the definition of the probability P(E), we see that the numerator (number\nof outcomes favourable to the event E) is always less than or equal to the denominator\n(the number of all possible outcomes). Therefore,\n0  P(E)  1\nNow, let us take an example related to playing cards. Have you seen a deck of\nplaying cards? It consists of 52 cards which are divided into 4 suits of 13 cards each—\nspades (), hearts (), diamonds () and clubs (). Clubs and spades are of black\ncolour, while hearts and diamonds are of red colour. The cards in each suit are ace,\nking, queen, jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2. Kings, queens and jacks are called face\ncards. Example 4 : One card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. Calculate the\nprobability that the card will\n(i) be an ace,\n(ii) not be an ace. Solution : Well-shuffling ensures equally likely outcomes. (i) There are 4 aces in a deck. Let E be the event ‘the card is an ace’. The number of outcomes favourable to E = 4\nThe number of possible outcomes = 52 (Why ?)\n4 1\nTherefore, P(E) = \n52 13\n(ii) Let F be the event ‘card drawn is not an ace’. The number of outcomes favourable to the event F = 52 – 4 = 48 (Why?)\nReprint 2025-26\n208 MATHEMATICS\nThe number of possible outcomes = 52\n48 12\nTherefore, P(F) = \n52 13\nRemark : Note that F is nothing but E. Therefore, we can also calculate P(F) as\n1 12\nfollows: P(F) = P(E) = 1 – P(E) = 1  \n13 13\nExample 5 : Two players, Sangeeta and Reshma, play a tennis match. It is known\nthat the probability of Sangeeta winning the match is 0.62. What is the probability of\nReshma winning the match? Solution : Let S and R denote the events that Sangeeta wins the match and Reshma\nwins the match, respectively. The probability of Sangeeta’s winning = P(S) = 0.62 (given)\nThe probability of Reshma’s winning = P(R) = 1 – P(S)\n[As the events R and S are complementary]\n= 1 – 0.62 = 0.38\nExample 6 : Savita and Hamida are friends. What is the probability that both will\nhave (i) different birthdays? (ii) the same birthday? (ignoring a leap year). Solution : Out of the two friends, one girl, say, Savita’s birthday can be any day of the\nyear. Now, Hamida’s birthday can also be any day of 365 days in the year. We assume that these 365 outcomes are equally likely.", "(i) If Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s, the number of favourable outcomes\nfor her birthday is 365 – 1 = 364\n364\nSo, P (Hamida’s birthday is different from Savita’s birthday) =\n365\n(ii) P(Savita and Hamida have the same birthday)\n= 1 – P (both have different birthdays)\n364\n= 1 [Using P(E) = 1 – P(E)]\n365\n1\n=\n365\nReprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 209\nExample 7 : There are 40 students in Class X of a school of whom 25 are girls and 15\nare boys. The class teacher has to select one student as a class representative. She\nwrites the name of each student on a separate card, the cards being identical. Then\nshe puts cards in a bag and stirs them thoroughly. She then draws one card from the\nbag. What is the probability that the name written on the card is the name of (i) a girl? (ii) a boy? Solution : There are 40 students, and only one name card has to be chosen. (i) The number of all possible outcomes is 40\nThe number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a girl = 25 (Why?)\n25 5\nTherefore, P (card with name of a girl) = P(Girl) = \n40 8\n(ii) The number of outcomes favourable for a card with the name of a boy = 15 (Why?)\n15 3\nTherefore, P(card with name of a boy) = P(Boy) = \n40 8\nNote : We can also determine P(Boy), by taking\n5 3\nP(Boy) = 1 – P(not Boy) = 1 – P(Girl) = 1 \n8 8\nExample 8 : A box contains 3 blue, 2 white, and 4 red marbles. If a marble is drawn\nat random from the box, what is the probability that it will be\n(i) white? (ii) blue? (iii) red? Solution : Saying that a marble is drawn at random is a short way of saying that all the\nmarbles are equally likely to be drawn. Therefore, the\nnumber of possible outcomes = 3 +2 + 4 = 9 (Why?)\nLet W denote the event ‘the marble is white’, B denote the event ‘the marble is blue’\nand R denote the event ‘marble is red’. (i) The number of outcomes favourable to the event W = 2\n2\nSo, P(W) =\n9\n3 1 4\nSimilarly, (ii) P(B) = = and (iii) P(R) =\n9 3 9\nNote that P(W) + P(B) + P(R) = 1.

Solution : We write H for ‘head’ and T for ‘tail’. When two coins are tossed\nsimultaneously, the possible outcomes are (H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T), which are all\nequally likely. Here (H, H) means head up on the first coin (say on ` 1) and head up\non the second coin (` 2). Similarly (H, T) means head up on the first coin and tail up on\nthe second coin and so on. The outcomes favourable to the event E, ‘at least one head’ are (H, H), (H, T)\nand (T, H). (Why?)\nSo, the number of outcomes favourable to E is 3. 3\nTherefore, P(E) =\n4\n3\ni.e., the probability that Harpreet gets at least one head is \n4\nNote : You can also find P(E) as follows:\n1 3  1\nP (E) = 1– P(E) =1–  Since P(E) = P(no head) = \n4 4  4\nDid you observe that in all the examples discussed so far, the number of possible\noutcomes in each experiment was finite?", "If not, check it now. There are many experiments in which the outcome is any number between two\ngiven numbers, or in which the outcome is every point within a circle or rectangle, etc. Can you now count the number of all possible outcomes? As you know, this is not\npossible since there are infinitely many numbers between two given numbers, or there\nare infinitely many points within a circle. So, the definition of (theoretical) probability\nwhich you have learnt so far cannot be applied in the present form. What is the way\nout? To answer this, let us consider the following example :\nExample 10* : In a musical chair game, the person playing the music has been\nadvised to stop playing the music at any time within 2 minutes after she starts\nplaying. What is the probability that the music will stop within the first half-minute\nafter starting? Solution : Here the possible outcomes are all the numbers between 0 and 2.

What is the probability that\n(i) it is acceptable to Jimmy? (ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha? Solution : One shirt is drawn at random from the carton of 100 shirts. Therefore,\nthere are 100 equally likely outcomes.", "(i) The number of outcomes favourable (i.e., acceptable) to Jimmy = 88 (Why?)\n88\nTherefore, P (shirt is acceptable to Jimmy) =  0.88\n100\n(ii) The number of outcomes favourable to Sujatha = 88 + 8 = 96 (Why?)\n96\nSo, P (shirt is acceptable to Sujatha) =  0.96\n100\nExample 13 : Two dice, one blue and one grey, are thrown at the same time.

Therefore, for each of these outcomes, the\n1\nprobability is \n3\n(ii) If a die is thrown, there are two possible outcomes—an odd number or an even\n1\nnumber. Therefore, the probability of getting an odd number is . 2\n14.2 Summary\nIn this chapter, you have studied the following points :\n1. The theoretical (classical) probability of an event E, written as P(E), is defined as\nNumber of outcomes favourable to E\nP (E) =\nNumber of all possible outcomes of the experiment\nwhere we assume that the outcomes of the experiment are equally likely. 2. The probability of a sure event (or certain event) is 1. 3. The probability of an impossible event is 0. 4. The probability of an event E is a number P(E) such that\n0  P (E)  1\n5. An event having only one outcome is called an elementary event. The sum of the\nprobabilities of all the elementary events of an experiment is 1. 6. For any event E, P (E) + P (E) = 1, where E stands for ‘not E’. E and E are called\ncomplementary events.", "A N R\nOTETOTHE EADER\nThe experimental or empirical probability of an event is based on\nwhat has actually happened while the theoretical probability of the\nevent attempts to predict what will happen on the basis of certain\nassumptions. As the number of trials in an experiment, go on\nincreasing we may expect the experimental and theoretical\nprobabilities to be nearly the same. Reprint 2025-26"]
