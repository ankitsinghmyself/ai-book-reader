["Chapter Four\nMOVING CHARGES\nAND MAGNETISM\n4.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nBoth Electricity and Magnetism have been known for more than 2000\nyears. However, it was only about 200 years ago, in 1820, that it was\nrealised that they were intimately related. During a lecture demonstration\nin the summer of 1820, Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted noticed\nthat a current in a straight wire caused a noticeable deflection in a nearby\nmagnetic compass needle. He investigated this phenomenon. He found\nthat the alignment of the needle is tangential to an imaginary circle which\nhas the straight wire as its centre and has its plane perpendicular to the\nwire. This situation is depicted in Fig.4.1(a). It is noticeable when the\ncurrent is large and the needle sufficiently close to the wire so that the\nearth’s magnetic field may be ignored. Reversing the direction of the\ncurrent reverses the orientation of the needle [Fig. 4.1(b)]. The deflection\nincreases on increasing the current or bringing the needle closer to the\nwire. Iron filings sprinkled around the wire arrange themselves in\nconcentric circles with the wire as the centre [Fig. 4.1(c)]. Oersted\nconcluded that moving charges or currents produced a magnetic field\nin the surrounding space. Following this, there was intense experimentation. In 1864, the laws\nobeyed by electricity and magnetism were unified and formulated by\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nJames Maxwell who then realised that light was electromagnetic waves. Radio waves were discovered by Hertz, and produced by J.C.Bose and\nG. Marconi by the end of the 19th century. A remarkable scientific and\ntechnological progress took place in the 20th century. This was due to\nour increased understanding of electromagnetism and the invention of\ndevices for production, amplification, transmission and detection of\nelectromagnetic waves.

Dimensionally, we have [B] = [F/qv] and the unit\nof B are Newton second / (coulomb metre). This unit is called tesla (T)\nnamed after Nikola Tesla (1856 – 1943). Tesla is a rather large unit. A\nsmaller unit (non-SI) called gauss (=10–4 tesla) is also often used. The\nearth’s magnetic field is about 3.6 × 10–5 T. 4.2.3 Magnetic force on a current-carrying conductor\nWe can extend the analysis for force due to magnetic field on a single\nmoving charge to a straight rod carrying current. Consider a rod of a\nuniform cross-sectional area A and length l. We shall assume one kind\nof mobile carriers as in a conductor (here electrons). Let the number\ndensity of these mobile charge carriers in it be n.", "Then the total number\nof mobile charge carriers in it is nlA. For a steady current I in this\nconducting rod, we may assume that each mobile carrier has an average\ndrift velocity v (see Chapter 3). In the presence of an external magnetic\nd\nfield B, the force on these carriers is:\nF = (nlA)q v ····· B\nd\nwhere q is the value of the charge on a carrier. Now nq v is the current\nd\ndensity j and |(nq v )|A is the current I (see Chapter 3 for the discussion\nd\nof current and current density). Thus,\nF = [(nq v )lA] × B = [ jAl ] ····· B\nd\n= Il ····· B (4.4)\nwhere l is a vector of magnitude l, the length of the rod, and with a direction\nidentical to the current I. Note that the current I is not a vector. In the last\nstep leading to Eq. (4.4), we have transferred the vector sign from j to l. Equation (4.4) holds for a straight rod. In this equation, B is the\nexternal magnetic field. It is not the field produced by the current-carrying\nrod. If the wire has an arbitrary shape we can calculate the Lorentz force\non it by considering it as a collection of linear strips dl and summing\nj\nF  Idl ×B\nj\nj\n110\nThis summation can be converted to an integral in most cases.

So, (a) for electron it will be along –z\naxis. (b) for a positive charge (proton) the force is along +z axis. 4.2\n111\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n4.3 M M F\nOTION IN A AGNETIC IELD\nWe will now consider, in greater detail, the motion of a charge moving in\na magnetic field. We have learnt in Mechanics (see Class XI book, Chapter\n5) that a force on a particle does work if the force has a component along\n(or opposed to) the direction of motion of the particle. In the case of motion\nof a charge in a magnetic field, the magnetic force is perpendicular to the\nvelocity of the particle.", "So no work is done and no change in the magnitude\nof the velocity is produced (though the direction of momentum may be\nchanged). [Notice that this is unlike the force due to an electric field, qE,\nwhich can have a component parallel (or antiparallel) to motion and thus\ncan transfer energy in addition to momentum.]\nWe shall consider motion of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic\nfield. First consider the case of v perpendicular to B. The\nperpendicular force, q v × B, acts as a centripetal force and\nproduces a circular motion perpendicular to the magnetic field. The particle will describe a circle if v and B are perpendicular\nto each other (Fig. 4.5). If velocity has a component along B, this component\nremains unchanged as the motion along the magnetic field will\nnot be affected by the magnetic field. The motion in a plane\nperpendicular to B is as before a circular one, thereby producing\na helical motion (Fig. 4.6). You have already learnt in earlier classes (See Class XI,\nChapter 3) that if r is the radius of the circular path of a particle,\nthen a force of m v2 / r, acts perpendicular to the path towards\nthe centre of the circle, and is called the centripetal force. If the\nFIGURE 4.5 Circular motion velocity v is perpendicular to the magnetic field B, the magnetic\nforce is perpendicular to both v and B and acts like a\ncentripetal force. It has a magnitude q v B. Equating the two expressions for centripetal\nforce,\nm v 2/r = q v B, which gives\nr = m v / qB (4.5)\nfor the radius of the circle described by the\ncharged particle. The larger the momentum, the\nlarger is the radius and bigger the circle\ndescribed. If w is the angular frequency, then v\n= w r. So,\nw = 2p n = q B/ m [4.6(a)]\nwhich is independent of the velocity or energy . Here n is the frequency of rotation. The\nindependence of n from energy has important\napplication in the design of a cyclotron. The time taken for one revolution is T= 2p/\nw ” 1/n.

Some\nof these are:\n(i) Both are long range, since both depend inversely on the square of\ndistance from the source to the point of interest. The principle of\nsuperposition applies to both fields. [In this connection, note that\nthe magnetic field is linear in the source I dl just as the electrostatic\nfield is linear in its source: the electric charge.]\n(ii) The electrostatic field is produced by a scalar source, namely, the electric\ncharge. The magnetic field is produced by a vector source I dl. (iii) The electrostatic field is along the displacement vector joining the\nsource and the field point. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the\nplane containing the displacement vector rand the current element I dl. (iv) There is an angle dependence in the Biot-Savart law which is not\npresent in the electrostatic case. In Fig. 4.7, the magnetic field at any\npoint in the direction of dl (the dashed line) is zero.", "Along this line,\nθ = 0, sin θ = 0 and from Eq. [4.7(a)], |dB| = 0.

(i) It implies that the field at every point on a circle of\nradius r, (with the wire along the axis), is same in\n118\nmagnitude. In other words, the magnetic field\nReprint 2025-26\nMoving Charges and\nMagnetism\npossesses what is called a cylindrical symmetry. The field that\nnormally can depend on three coordinates depends only on one: r. Whenever there is symmetry, the solutions simplify. (ii) The field direction at any point on this circle is tangential to it. Thus, the lines of constant magnitude of magnetic field form\nconcentric circles. Notice now, in Fig. 4.1(c), the iron filings form\nconcentric circles. These lines called magnetic field lines form closed\nloops. This is unlike the electrostatic field lines which originate\nfrom positive charges and end at negative charges. The expression\nfor the magnetic field of a straight wire provides a theoretical\njustification to Oersted’s experiments. (iii) Another interesting point to note is that even though the wire is\ninfinite, the field due to it at a non-zero distance is not infinite. It\ntends to blow up only when we come very close to the wire. The\nfield is directly proportional to the current and inversely\nproportional to the distance from the (infinitely long) current source. (iv) There exists a simple rule to determine the direction of the magnetic\nfield due to a long wire. This rule, called the right-hand rule*, is:\nGrasp the wire in your right hand with your extended thumb pointing\nin the direction of the current. Your fingers will curl around in the\ndirection of the magnetic field. Ampere’s circuital law is not new in content from Biot-Savart law. Both relate the magnetic field and the current, and both express the same\nphysical consequences of a steady electrical current. Ampere’s law is to\nBiot-Savart law, what Gauss’s law is to Coulomb’s law. Both, Ampere’s\nand Gauss’s law relate a physical quantity on the periphery or boundary\n(magnetic or electric field) to another physical quantity, namely, the source,\nin the interior (current or charge). We also note that Ampere’s circuital\nlaw holds for steady currents which do not fluctuate with time. The\nfollowing example will help us understand what is meant by the term\nenclosed current.

This example possesses the required symmetry so that Ampere’s\nE law can be applied readily. It should be noted that while Ampere’s circuital law holds for any\nloop, it may not always facilitate an evaluation of the magnetic field in\nevery case. For example, for the case of the circular loop discussed in\nSection 4.5, it cannot be applied to extract the simple expression\nB = µI/2R [Eq. (4.12)] for the field at the centre of the loop.

In Fig.", "4.15(b), we see that the field at the\ninterior mid-point P is uniform, strong and along the axis of the solenoid.

The results obtained above can be shown to apply to any planar loop:\na planar current loop is equivalent to a magnetic dipole of dipole moment\nm = I A, which is the analogue of electric dipole moment p. Note, however,\na fundamental difference: an electric dipole is built up of two elementary\nunits — the charges (or electric monopoles). In magnetism, a magnetic\ndipole (or a current loop) is the most elementary element. The equivalent\nof electric charges, i.e., magnetic monopoles, are not known to exist. We have shown that a current loop (i) produces a magnetic field (see\nFig. 4.10) and behaves like a magnetic dipole at large distances, and\n(ii) is subject to torque like a magnetic needle. This led Ampere to suggest\nthat all magnetism is due to circulating currents. This seems to be partly\ntrue and no magnetic monopoles have been seen so far. However,\nelementary particles such as an electron or a proton also carry an intrinsic\nmagnetic moment, not accounted by circulating currents. 4.10 T M C G\nHE OVING OIL ALVANOMETER\nCurrents and voltages in circuits have been discussed extensively in\nChapters 3.

The galvanometer cannot as such be used as an\nammeter to measure the value of the current in a given circuit. This is for\ntwo reasons: (i) Galvanometer is a very sensitive device, it gives a full-\nscale deflection for a current of the order of µA. (ii) For measuring currents,\nthe galvanometer has to be connected in series, and as it has a large\nresistance, this will change the value of the current in the circuit. To\novercome these difficulties, one attaches a small resistance r , called shunt\ns\nresistance, in parallel with the galvanometer coil; so that most of the\ncurrent passes through the shunt. The resistance of this arrangement is,\n≃\nR r / (R + r ) r if R >> r\nG s G s s G s\nIf r has small value, in relation to the resistance of the rest of the\ns\ncircuit R , the effect of introducing the measuring instrument is also small\nc\nand negligible. This arrangement is schematically shown in Fig. 4.21.", "FIGURE 4.21 The scale of this ammeter is calibrated and then graduated to read off\nConversion of a the current value with ease.

Reprint 2025-26\nMoving Charges and\nMagnetism\nThe galvanometer can also be used as a voltmeter to measure the\nvoltage across a given section of the circuit. For this it must be connected\nin parallel with that section of the circuit. Further, it must draw a very\nsmall current, otherwise the voltage measurement will disturb the original\nset up by an amount which is very large. Usually we like to keep the\ndisturbance due to the measuring device below one per cent. To ensure\nthis, a large resistance R is connected in series with the galvanometer. This arrangement is schematically depicted in Fig.4.22. Note that the\nresistance of the voltmeter is now,\nFIGURE 4.22\n≃\nR + R R : large\nG Conversion of a\nThe scale of the voltmeter is calibrated to read off the voltage value galvanometer (G) to a\nwith ease.

So in general, the modification needed for conversion\nof a galvanometer to an ammeter will be different from what is needed for\nconverting it into a voltmeter.

The total force on a charge q moving with velocity v in the presence of\nmagnetic and electric fields B and E, respectively is called the Lorentz\nforce. It is given by the expression:\nF = q (v × B + E)\nThe magnetic force q (v × B) is normal to v and work done by it is zero. 2. A straight conductor of length l and carrying a steady current I\nexperiences a force F in a uniform external magnetic field B,\nF = I l × B\nwhere|l| = l and the direction of l is given by the direction of the\ncurrent. 3. In a uniform magnetic field B, a charge q executes a circular orbit in\na plane normal to B. Its frequency of uniform circular motion is called\nthe cyclotron frequency and is given by:\nqB\nn =\nc 2p m\nThis frequency is independent of the particle’s speed and radius. This\nfact is exploited in a machine, the cyclotron, which is used to\naccelerate charged particles. 4. The Biot-Savart law asserts that the magnetic field dB due to an\nelement dl carrying a steady current I at a point P at a distance r from\nthe current element is:\nm dl· r\ndB = 0 I\n4p r3\nTo obtain the total field at P, we must integrate this vector expression\nover the entire length of the conductor. 5. The magnitude of the magnetic field due to a circular coil of radius R\ncarrying a current I at an axial distance x from the centre is\n132\nReprint 2025-26\nMoving Charges and\nMagnetism\nm IR2\nB = 0\n2(x2 +R2)3/2\nAt the centre this reduces to\nm I\nB = 0\n2R\n6. Ampere’s Circuital Law: Let an open surface S be bounded by a loop\nC. Then the Ampere’s law states that ∫Ñ B.dl= µ I where I refers to\n0\nC\nthe current passing through S. The sign of I is determined from the\nright-hand rule. We have discussed a simplified form of this law. If B\nis directed along the tangent to every point on the perimeter L of a\nclosed curve and is constant in magnitude along perimeter then,\nBL = µ I\n0 e\nwhere I is the net current enclosed by the closed circuit. e\n7. The magnitude of the magnetic field at a distance R from a long,\nstraight wire carrying a current I is given by:\nm I\nB = 0\n2πR\nThe field lines are circles concentric with the wire. 8. The magnitude of the field B inside a long solenoid carrying a current\nI is\nB = µnI\n0\nwhere n is the number of turns per unit length. 9. Parallel currents attract and anti-parallel currents repel. 10. A planar loop carrying a current I, having N closely wound turns, and\nan area A possesses a magnetic moment m where,\nm = N I A\nand the direction of m is given by the right-hand thumb rule : curl\nthe palm of your right hand along the loop with the fingers pointing\nin the direction of the current.", "The thumb sticking out gives the\ndirection of m (and A)\nWhen this loop is placed in a uniform magnetic field B, the force F on\nit is: F = 0\nAnd the torque on it is,\nτ = m × B\nIn a moving coil galvanometer, this torque is balanced by a counter-\ntorque due to a spring, yielding\nkφ = NI AB\nwhere φ is the equilibrium deflection and k the torsion constant of\nthe spring. 11. A moving coil galvanometer can be converted into a ammeter by\nintroducing a shunt resistance r, of small value in parallel. It can be\ns\nconverted into a voltmeter by introducing a resistance of a large value\nin series. 133\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nPhysical Quantity Symbol Nature Dimensions Units Remarks\nPermeability of free µ Scalar [MLT–2A–2] T m A–1 4π × 10–7 T m A–1\n0\nspace\nMagnetic Field B Vector [M T–2A–1] T (telsa)\nMagnetic Moment m Vector [L2A] A m2 or J/T\nTorsion Constant k Scalar [M L2T–2] N m rad–1 Appears in MCG\nPOINTS TO PONDER\n1. Electrostatic field lines originate at a positive charge and terminate at a\nnegative charge or fade at infinity. Magnetic field lines always form\nclosed loops. 2. The discussion in this Chapter holds only for steady currents which do\nnot vary with time. When currents vary with time Newton’s third law is valid only if momentum\ncarried by the electromagnetic field is taken into account. 3. Recall the expression for the Lorentz force,\nF = q (v × B + E)\nThis velocity dependent force has occupied the attention of some of the\ngreatest scientific thinkers. If one switches to a frame with instantaneous\nvelocity v, the magnetic part of the force vanishes. The motion of the\ncharged particle is then explained by arguing that there exists an\nappropriate electric field in the new frame. We shall not discuss the\ndetails of this mechanism. However, we stress that the resolution of this\nparadox implies that electricity and magnetism are linked phenomena\n(electromagnetism) and that the Lorentz force expression does not imply\na universal preferred frame of reference in nature. 4. Ampere’s Circuital law is not independent of the Biot-Savart law. It\ncan be derived from the Biot-Savart law. Its relationship to the\nBiot-Savart law is similar to the relationship between Gauss’s law and\nCoulomb’s law.
