This principle marks a departure from the\nlegacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap\nbetween the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the\nbasis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the\ndirection of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (1986).", "The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children\ngenerate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key\nreasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity\nand initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not\nas receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities\nrequiring hands-on experience. Reprint 2025-26\niv\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in\nScience and Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProfessor P.K. Jain for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this\npossible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products,\nNCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further\nrevision and refinement. Director\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 November 2006 Research and Training\nReprint 2025-26\nRationalisation of Content in the Textbooks\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on students. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and\nproviding opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background,\nthe NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken\ninto consideration in this exercise.", "Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from\nteachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. Reprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\nPreface\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted\n21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education,\nto review the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000\n(NCFSE - 2000) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in\nthe fields of content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International\nspectrum of school education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments\nin their respective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups, National\nCurriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed. NCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development\nTeams for Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in Mathematics under the new\nguidelines and new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was\nbrought in 2005. The first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team\nconsisting of NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined\nby the development team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed\nto a group of practicing teachers teaching Mathematics at higher secondary stage\nin different parts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at\nDelhi. The teachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated\nin the draft textbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted\nout of the development team. Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics\nand the Monitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India\nhave approved the draft of the textbook. In the fitness of things, let us cite some of the essential features dominating the\ntextbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters. The existing\ntextbook contains thirteen main chapters and two appendices. Each chapter contains\nthe followings :\n§\nIntroduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier\nstudied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the\nchapter. §\nOrganisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/\nsubconcepts. §\nMotivating and introducing the concepts/subconcepts. Illustrations have been\nprovided wherever possible.", "Reprint 2025-26\nviii\n§\nProofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity\nof approaches wherever possible have been inducted. §\nGeometric viewing / visualisation of concepts have been emphasized whenever\nneeded. §\nApplications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied\nsubjects like Science and Social Sciences. §\nAdequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section. §\nFor refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving\nand applicabilities, miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been\nprovided involving two or more subconcepts at a time at the end of the chapter. The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected\nconducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005. §\nFor more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been\nprovided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter, relevant\nquotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed\nsignificantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided. §\nLastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief\nsummary of the chapter has also been provided. I am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the\nteam and invited me to join this national endeavour for the improvement of Mathematics\neducation. He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive\nenvironment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and\nrewarding. I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the Advisory\nGroup in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice towards\nthe improvement of the book from time to time. I, also, thank Professor\nG. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT for his help from time to time. I express my sincere thanks to Professor Hukum Singh, Chief Coordinator and\nHead, DESM, Dr. V. P. Singh, Coordinator and Professor, S. K. Singh Gautam who\nhave been helping for the success of this project academically as well as administratively. Also, I would like to place on records my appreciation and thanks to all the members\nof the team and the teachers who have been associated with this noble cause in one or\nthe other form. PAWAN K.
