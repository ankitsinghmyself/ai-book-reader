["34 MATHEMATICS\n3\nChapter\nMATRICES\nvThe essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom. — CANTOR v\n3.1 Introduction\nThe knowledge of matrices is necessary in various branches of mathematics. Matrices\nare one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. This mathematical tool simplifies\nour work to a great extent when compared with other straight forward methods. The\nevolution of concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and\nsimple methods of solving system of linear equations. Matrices are not only used as a\nrepresentation of the coefficients in system of linear equations, but utility of matrices\nfar exceeds that use. Matrix notation and operations are used in electronic spreadsheet\nprograms for personal computer, which in turn is used in different areas of business\nand science like budgeting, sales projection, cost estimation, analysing the results of an\nexperiment etc. Also, many physical operations such as magnification, rotation and\nreflection through a plane can be represented mathematically by matrices. Matrices\nare also used in cryptography. This mathematical tool is not only used in certain branches\nof sciences, but also in genetics, economics, sociology, modern psychology and industrial\nmanagement. In this chapter, we shall find it interesting to become acquainted with the\nfundamentals of matrix and matrix algebra. 3.2 Matrix\nSuppose we wish to express the information that Radha has 15 notebooks. We may\nexpress it as [15] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of\nnotebooks that Radha has. Now, if we have to express that Radha has 15 notebooks\nand 6 pens. We may express it as [15 6] with the understanding that first number\ninside [ ] is the number of notebooks while the other one is the number of pens possessed\nby Radha. Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession\nReprint 2025-26\nMATRICES 35\nof notebooks and pens by Radha and her two friends Fauzia and Simran which\nis as follows:\nRadha has 15 notebooks and 6 pens,\nFauzia has 10 notebooks and 2 pens,\nSimran has 13 notebooks and 5 pens. Now this could be arranged in the tabular form as follows:\nNotebooks Pens\nRadha 15 6\nFauzia 10 2\nSimran 13 5\nand this can be expressed as\nor\nRadha Fauzia Simran\nNotebooks 15 10 13\nPens 6 2 5\nwhich can be expressed as:\nIn the first arrangement the entries in the first column represent the number of\nnote books possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively and the entries in the\nsecond column represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran,\nReprint 2025-26\n36 MATHEMATICS\nrespectively. Similarly, in the second arrangement, the entries in the first row represent\nthe number of notebooks possessed by Radha, Fauzia and Simran, respectively. The\nentries in the second row represent the number of pens possessed by Radha, Fauzia\nand Simran, respectively. An arrangement or display of the above kind is called a\nmatrix.", "Formally, we define matrix as:\nDefinition 1 A matrix is an ordered rectangular array of numbers or functions. The\nnumbers or functions are called the elements or the entries of the matrix. We denote matrices by capital letters. The following are some examples of matrices:\n 1\n2+i 3 −\n–2 5  \n2\n\n    1+x x3 3 \nA= 0 5, B=3.5 –1 2 , C= \n  3 6    5   cosx sinx+2 tanx \n 3 5 \n 7 \nIn the above examples, the horizontal lines of elements are said to constitute, rows\nof the matrix and the vertical lines of elements are said to constitute, columns of the\nmatrix. Thus A has 3 rows and 2 columns, B has 3 rows and 3 columns while C has 2\nrows and 3 columns. 3.2.1 Order of a matrix\nA matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n\nmatrix (read as an m by n matrix). So referring to the above examples of matrices, we\nhave A as 3 × 2 matrix, B as 3 × 3 matrix and C as 2 × 3 matrix. We observe that A has\n3 × 2 = 6 elements, B and C have 9 and 6 elements, respectively. In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array:\nor A = [a ] , 1≤ i ≤ m, 1≤ j ≤ n i, j ∈ N\nij m × n\nThus the ith row consists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a , while the jth column\ni1 i2 i3 in\nconsists of the elements a , a , a ,..., a ,\n1j 2j 3j mj\nIn general a , is an element lying in the ith row and jth column. We can also call\nij\nit as the (i, j)th element of A. The number of elements in an m × n matrix will be\nequal to mn. Reprint 2025-26\nMATRICES 37\nA\nNote In this chapter\n1. We shall follow the notation, namely A = [a ] to indicate that A is a matrix\nij m × n\nof order m × n. 2. We shall consider only those matrices whose elements are real numbers or\nfunctions taking real values. We can also represent any point (x, y) in a plane by a matrix (column or row) as\nx\n  (or [x, y]). For example point P(0, 1) as a matrix representation may be given as\ny\n0\nP= or [0 1].  \n1\nObserve that in this way we can also express the vertices of a closed rectilinear\nfigure in the form of a matrix. For example, consider a quadrilateral ABCD with vertices\nA (1, 0), B (3, 2), C (1, 3), D (–1, 2). Now, quadrilateral ABCD in the matrix form, can be represented as\nA B C D A1 0\n \n1 3 1 −1 B 3 2\nX=   or Y=  \n0 2 3 2 C1 3\n2×4  \nD−1 2\n4×2\nThus, matrices can be used as representation of vertices of geometrical figures in\na plane. Now, let us consider some examples. Example 1 Consider the following information regarding the number of men and women\nworkers in three factories I, II and III\nMen workers Women workers\nI 30 25\nII 25 31\nIII 27 26\nRepresent the above information in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix. What does the entry\nin the third row and second column represent? Reprint 2025-26\n38 MATHEMATICS\nSolution The information is represented in the form of a 3 × 2 matrix as follows:\n30 25\n \nA= 25 31\n \n 27 26 \nThe entry in the third row and second column represents the number of women\nworkers in factory III.", "Example 2 If a matrix has 8 elements, what are the possible orders it can have? Solution We know that if a matrix is of order m × n, it has mn elements. Thus, to find\nall possible orders of a matrix with 8 elements, we will find all ordered pairs of natural\nnumbers, whose product is 8. Thus, all possible ordered pairs are (1, 8), (8, 1), (4, 2), (2, 4)\nHence, possible orders are 1 × 8, 8 ×1, 4 × 2, 2 × 4\n1\nExample 3 Construct a 3 × 2 matrix whose elements are given by a = |i−3j|. ij 2\na a \n11 12\n \nSolution In general a 3 × 2 matrix is given by A= a a .  21 22\n a a  \n31 32\n1\nNow a = |i−3j|, i = 1, 2, 3 and j = 1, 2. ij 2\n1 1 5\nTherefore a = |1−3×1|=1 a = |1−3×2|=\n11 2 12 2 2\n1 1 1\na = |2−3×1|= a = |2−3×2|=2\n21 2 2 22 2\n1 1 3\na = |3−3×1|=0 a = |3−3×2|=\n31 2 32 2 2\n 5\n1\n \n2\n1 \nHence the required matrix is given by A= 2. 2\n \n3\n0 \n 2\nReprint 2025-26\nMATRICES 39\n3.3 Types of Matrices\nIn this section, we shall discuss different types of matrices. (i) Column matrix\nA matrix is said to be a column matrix if it has only one column.  0 \n \n 3\nFor example, A=  −1  is a column matrix of order 4 × 1.  \n1/2\nIn general, A = [a ] is a column matrix of order m × 1. ij m × 1\n(ii) Row matrix\nA matrix is said to be a row matrix if it has only one row.  1 \nFor example, B= − 5 2 3 is a row matrix.  \n 2 \n1×4\nIn general, B = [b ] is a row matrix of order 1 × n. ij 1 × n\n(iii) Square matrix\nA matrix in which the number of rows are equal to the number of columns, is\nsaid to be a square matrix. Thus an m × n matrix is said to be a square matrix if\nm = n and is known as a square matrix of order ‘n’. 3 −1 0 \n \n3\nFor example A= 3 2 1  is a square matrix of order 3. 2 \n \n4 3 −1\nIn general, A = [a ] is a square matrix of order m. ij m × m\nA\nNote If A = [a] is a square matrix of order n, then elements (entries) a , a , ..., a\nij 11 22 nn\n1 −3 1 \n \nare said to constitute the diagonal, of the matrix A. Thus, if A= 2 4 −1 .  \n 3 5 6 \nThen the elements of the diagonal of A are 1, 4, 6. Reprint 2025-26\n40 MATHEMATICS\n(iv) Diagonal matrix\nA square matrix B = [b ] is said to be a diagonal matrix if all its non\nij m × m\ndiagonal elements are zero, that is a matrix B = [b ] is said to be a diagonal\nij m × m\nmatrix if b = 0, when i ≠ j. ij\n−1.1 0 0\n−1 0  \nFor example, A = [4], B=  , C=  0 2 0  , are diagonal matrices\n0 2\n  0 0 3 \nof order 1, 2, 3, respectively. (v) Scalar matrix\nA diagonal matrix is said to be a scalar matrix if its diagonal elements are equal,\nthat is, a square matrix B = [b ] is said to be a scalar matrix if\nij n × n\nb = 0, when i ≠ j\nij\nb = k, when i = j, for some constant k. ij\nFor example\n 3 0 0 \n−1 0   \nA = [3], B=   , C= 0 3 0 \n0 −1  \n 0 0 3\nare scalar matrices of order 1, 2 and 3, respectively. (vi) Identity matrix\nA square matrix in which elements in the diagonal are all 1 and rest are all zero\nis called an identity matrix.", "In other words, the square matrix A = [a ] is an\nij n × n\n1 if i= j\nidentity matrix, if a = . ij 0 if i≠ j\nWe denote the identity matrix of order n by I . When order is clear from the\nn\ncontext, we simply write it as I. 1 0 0\n1 0  \n0 1 0\nFor example [1],  ,   are identity matrices of order 1, 2 and 3,\n0 1\n 0 0 1 \nrespectively. Observe that a scalar matrix is an identity matrix when k = 1. But every identity\nmatrix is clearly a scalar matrix. Reprint 2025-26\nMATRICES 41\n(vii) Zero matrix\nA matrix is said to be zero matrix or null matrix if all its elements are zero. 0 0 0 0 0\nFor example, [0],  ,  , [0, 0] are all zero matrices. We denote\n0 0 0 0 0\nzero matrix by O. Its order will be clear from the context. 3.3.1 Equality of matrices\nDefinition 2 Two matrices A = [a ] and B = [b ] are said to be equal if\nij ij\n(i) they are of the same order\n(ii) each element of A is equal to the corresponding element of B, that is a = b for\nij ij\nall i and j. 2 3 2 3 3 2 2 3\nFor example,   and   are equal matrices but   and   are\n0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\nnot equal matrices.

Each factory produces sport\nshoes for boys and girls in three different price categories labelled 1, 2 and 3. The\nquantities produced by each factory are represented as matrices given below:\nSuppose Fatima wants to know the total production of sport shoes in each price\ncategory. Then the total production\nIn category 1 : for boys (80 + 90), for girls (60 + 50)\nIn category 2 : for boys (75 + 70), for girls (65 + 55)\nIn category 3 : for boys (90 + 75), for girls (85 + 75)\n80+90 60+50\n \nThis can be represented in the matrix form as 75+70 65+55 .  \n 90+75 85+75 \nReprint 2025-26\n44 MATHEMATICS\nThis new matrix is the sum of the above two matrices. We observe that the sum of\ntwo matrices is a matrix obtained by adding the corresponding elements of the given\nmatrices. Furthermore, the two matrices have to be of the same order. a a a  b b b \nThus, if A= 11 12 13  is a 2 × 3 matrix and B= 11 12 13  is another\n a 21 a 22 a 23  b 21 b 22 b 23\na +b a +b a +b \n2×3 matrix.

We may observe that addition of matrices is an example of binary operation\non the set of matrices of the same order. 3.4.2 Multiplication of a matrix by a scalar\nNow suppose that Fatima has doubled the production at a factory A in all categories\n(refer to 3.4.1).", "Reprint 2025-26\nMATRICES 45\nPreviously quantities (in standard units) produced by factory A were\nRevised quantities produced by factory A are as given below:\nBoys Girls\n1 2×80 2×60\n \n2 2×75 2×65\n \n3  2×90 2×85 \n160 120\n \nThis can be represented in the matrix form as 150 130 .

Meera wants to buy 2 pens and 5 story\nbooks, while Nadeem needs 8 pens and 10 story books. They both go to a shop to\nenquire about the rates which are quoted as follows:\nPen – `5 each, story book – `50 each. How much money does each need to spend? Clearly, Meera needs `(5 × 2 + 50 × 5)\nthat is `260, while Nadeem needs (8 × 5 + 50 × 10) `, that is `540.

We observe that, for\nmultiplication of two matrices A and B, the number of columns in A should be equal to\nthe number of rows in B. Furthermore for getting the elements of the product matrix,\nwe take rows of A and columns of B, multiply them element-wise and take the sum. Formally, we define multiplication of matrices as follows:\nThe product of two matrices A and B is defined if the number of columns of A is\nequal to the number of rows of B. Let A = [a ] be an m × n matrix and B = [b ] be an\nij jk\nn × p matrix. Then the product of the matrices A and B is the matrix C of order m × p. To get the (i, k)th element c of the matrix C, we take the ith row of A and kth column\nik\nof B, multiply them elementwise and take the sum of all these products. In other words,\nif A = [a ] , B = [b ] , then the ith row of A is [a a ... a ] and the kth column of\nij m × n jk n × p i1 i2 in\nb \n1k\n \nb n\nB is   . 2k  , then c = a b + a b + a b + ... + a b = ∑a ij b jk . . ik i1 1k i2 2k i3 3k in nk\n .", " j=1\n \nb \nnk\nThe matrix C = [c ] is the product of A and B. ik m × p\n 2 7\n1 −1 2  \nFor example, if C= and D= −1 1 , then the product CD is defined\n   \n0 3 4\n  5 −4 \nReprint 2025-26\n52 MATHEMATICS\n 2 7\n1 −1 2\n \nand is given by CD=    −1 1  .

In the above example, AB is\ndefined but BA is not defined because B has 3 column while A has only 2 (and not 3)\nrows. If A, B are, respectively m × n, k × l matrices, then both AB and BA are defined\nif and only if n = k and l = m. In particular, if both A and B are square matrices of the\nsame order, then both AB and BA are defined.
