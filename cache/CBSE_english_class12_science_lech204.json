AMINES\nAmines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia,\nobtained by replacement of one, two or all the three\nhydrogen atoms by alkyl and/or aryl groups. For example:\n99999.....11111 SSSSStttttrrrrruuuuuccccctttttuuuuurrrrreeeee ooooofffff AAAAAmmmmmiiiiinnnnneeeeesssss Like ammonia, nitrogen atom of amines is trivalent and\ncarries an unshared pair of electrons. Nitrogen orbitals\nin amines are therefore, sp3 hybridised and the geometry\nof amines is pyramidal. Each of the three sp3 hybridised\norbitals of nitrogen overlap with orbitals of hydrogen or\ncarbon depending upon the composition of the amines. The fourth orbital of nitrogen in all amines contains an\nunshared pair of electrons. Due to the presence of\nunshared pair of electrons, the angle C–N–E, (where E is\nReprint 2025-26\nC or H) is less than 109.5°; for instance, it is 108o in case of\ntrimethylamine as shown in Fig. 9.1. Fig. 9.1 Pyramidal shape of trimethylamine\n99999.....22222 CCCCClllllaaaaassssssssssiiiiifffffiiiiicccccaaaaatttttiiiiiooooonnnnn Amines are classified as primary (1o), secondary (2o) and tertiary (3o)\ndepending upon the number of hydrogen atoms replaced by alkyl or\naryl groups in ammonia molecule. If one hydrogen atom of ammonia\nis replaced by R or Ar , we get RNH or ArNH , a primary amine (1o). 2 2\nIf two hydrogen atoms of ammonia or one hydrogen atom of R-NH are\n2\nreplaced by another alkyl/aryl(R’) group, what would you get? You\nget R-NHR’, secondary amine.", "The second alkyl/aryl group may be\nsame or different. Replacement of another hydrogen atom by alkyl/aryl\ngroup leads to the formation of tertiary amine. Amines are said to be\n‘simple’ when all the alkyl or aryl groups are the same, and ‘mixed’\nwhen they are different. 99999.....33333 NNNNNooooommmmmeeeeennnnnccccclllllaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrreeeee In common system, an aliphatic amine is named by prefixing alkyl\ngroup to amine, i.e., alkylamine as one word (e.g., methylamine). In\nsecondary and tertiary amines, when two or more groups are the same,\nthe prefix di or tri is appended before the name of alkyl group. In\nIUPAC system, primary amines are named as alkanamines. The name\nis derived by replacement of ‘e’ of alkane by the word amine. For\nexample, CH NH is named as methanamine. In case, more than one\n3 2\namino group is present at different positions in the parent chain, their\npositions are specified by giving numbers to the carbon atoms bearing\n–NH groups and suitable prefix such as di, tri, etc. is attached to the\n2\namine. The letter ‘e’ of the suffix of the hydrocarbon part is retained. For\nexample, H N–CH –CH –NH is named as ethane-1, 2-diamine. 2 2 2 2\nTo name secondary and tertiary amines, we use locant N to designate\nsubstituent attached to a nitrogen atom. For example, CH NHCH CH is\n3 2 3\nChemistry 260\nReprint 2025-26\nnamed as N-methylethanamine and (CH CH ) N is named as N, N-\n3 2 3\ndiethylethanamine. More examples are given in Table 9.1. In arylamines, –NH group is directly attached to the benzene ring. 2\nC H NH is the simplest example of arylamine. In common system, it\n6 5 2\nis known as aniline. It is also an accepted IUPAC name. While naming\narylamines according to IUPAC system, suffix ‘e’ of arene is replaced by\n‘amine’. Thus in IUPAC system, C H –NH is named as benzenamine. 6 5 2\nCommon and IUPAC names of some alkylamines and arylamines are\ngiven in Table 9.1.

Reduction of nitro compounds\nNitro compounds are reduced to amines by passing hydrogen gas\nin the presence of finely divided nickel, palladium or platinum and\nalso by reduction with metals in acidic medium. Nitroalkanes can\nalso be similarly reduced to the corresponding alkanamines. Reduction with iron scrap and hydrochloric acid is preferred because\nFeCl formed gets hydrolysed to release hydrochloric acid during the\n2\nreaction. Thus, only a small amount of hydrochloric acid is required\nto initiate the reaction. 2. Ammonolysis of alkyl halides\nYou have read (Unit 6, Class XII) that the carbon - halogen bond in\nalkyl or benzyl halides can be easily cleaved by a nucleophile. Hence,\nan alkyl or benzyl halide on reaction with an ethanolic solution of\nammonia undergoes nucleophilic substitution reaction in which the\nhalogen atom is replaced by an amino (–NH ) group. This process of\n2\ncleavage of the C–X bond by ammonia molecule is known as\nammonolysis. The reaction is carried out in a sealed tube at 373\nK. The primary amine thus obtained behaves as a nucleophile and\ncan further react with alkyl halide to form secondary and tertiary\namines, and finally quaternary ammonium salt. Chemistry 262\nReprint 2025-26\nThe free amine can be obtained from the ammonium salt by treatment\nwith a strong base:\nAmmonolysis has the disadvantage of yielding a mixture of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also a quaternary ammonium salt. However, primary amine is obtained as a major product by taking\nlarge excess of ammonia. The order of reactivity of halides with amines is RI > RBr >RCl.

Reduction of nitriles\nNitriles on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH ) or\n4\ncatalytic hydrogenation produce primary amines. This reaction is\nused for ascent of amine series, i.e., for preparation of amines\ncontaining one carbon atom more than the starting amine. 4. Reduction of amides\nThe amides on reduction with lithium aluminium hydride yield\namines. 263 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n5. Gabriel phthalimide synthesis\nGabriel synthesis is used for the preparation of primary amines. Phthalimide on treatment with ethanolic potassium hydroxide forms\npotassium salt of phthalimide which on heating with alkyl halide\nfollowed by alkaline hydrolysis produces the corresponding primary\namine. Aromatic primary amines cannot be prepared by this method\nbecause aryl halides do not undergo nucleophilic substitution with\nthe anion formed by phthalimide. 6.", "Hoffmann bromamide degradation reaction\nHoffmann developed a method for preparation of primary amines by\ntreating an amide with bromine in an aqueous or ethanolic solution\nof sodium hydroxide. In this degradation reaction, migration of an\nalkyl or aryl group takes place from carbonyl carbon of the amide\nto the nitrogen atom.

Aniline and other arylamines are usually colourless but get\ncoloured on storage due to atmospheric oxidation. Lower aliphatic amines are soluble in water because they can form\nhydrogen bonds with water molecules. However, solubility decreases\nwith increase in molar mass of amines due to increase in size of the\nhydrophobic alkyl part. Higher amines are essentially insoluble in water. Considering the electronegativity of nitrogen of amine and oxygen of\nalcohol as 3.0 and 3.5 respectively, you can predict the pattern of\nsolubility of amines and alcohols in water. Out of butan-1-ol and\nbutan-1-amine, which will be more soluble in water and why? Amines\nare soluble in organic solvents like alcohol, ether and benzene. You\nmay remember that alcohols are more polar than amines and form\nstronger intermolecular hydrogen bonds than amines. Primary and secondary amines are engaged in intermolecular\nassociation due to hydrogen bonding between nitrogen of one and\nhydrogen of another molecule. This intermolecular association is more\nin primary amines than in secondary amines as there are two hydrogen\natoms available for hydrogen bond formation in it.", "Tertiary amines do\nnot have intermolecular association due to the absence of hydrogen\natom available for hydrogen bond formation.

The number of hydrogen atoms attached to nitrogen\natom also decides the course of reaction of amines; that is why primary\n(–NH ), secondary N H and tertiary amines N differ in many\n2\nreactions. Moreover, amines behave as nucleophiles due to the presence\nof unshared electron pair. Some of the reactions of amines are described\nbelow:\n1. Basic character of amines\nAmines, being basic in nature, react with acids to form salts. Chemistry 266\nReprint 2025-26\nAmine salts on treatment with a base like NaOH, regenerate the\nparent amine. Amine salts are soluble in water but insoluble in organic solvents\nlike ether. This reaction is the basis for the separation of amines from\nthe non basic organic compounds insoluble in water. The reaction of amines with mineral acids to form ammonium salts\nshows that these are basic in nature. Amines have an unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis base. Basic character of amines can be better understood in terms of their K\nb\nand pK values as explained below:\nb\n   \nRNH OH\n3\nK =\nR NH H O\n2 2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K[H O] = 3\n2 RNH \n2\n   \nR NH OH\nor K = 3\nb R NH \n2\npK = –log K\nb b\nLarger the value of K or smaller the value of pK , stronger is the\nb b\nbase. The pK values of few amines are given in Table 9.3. b\npK value of ammonia is 4.75. Aliphatic amines are stronger bases\nb\nthan ammonia due to +I effect of alkyl groups leading to high electron\ndensity on the nitrogen atom. Their pK values lie in the range of 3 to\nb\n4.22. On the other hand, aromatic amines are weaker bases than\nammonia due to the electron withdrawing nature of the aryl group.", "Table 9.3: pK Values of Amines in Aqueous Phase\nb\nName of amine pK\nb\nMethanamine 3.38\nN-Methylmethanamine 3.27\nN,N-Dimethylmethanamine 4.22\nEthanamine 3.29\nN-Ethylethanamine 3.00\nN,N-Diethylethanamine 3.25\nBenzenamine 9.38\nPhenylmethanamine 4.70\nN-Methylaniline 9.30\nN,N-Dimethylaniline 8.92\n267 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nYou may find some discrepancies while trying to interpret the K\nb\nvalues of amines on the basis of +I or –I effect of the substituents\npresent in amines. Besides inductive effect, there are other effects like\nsolvation effect, steric hinderance, etc., which affect the basic strength\nof amines. Just ponder over. You may get the answer in the following\nparagraphs. Structure-basicity relationship of amines\nBasicity of amines is related to their structure. Basic character of\nan amine depends upon the ease of formation of the cation by\naccepting a proton from the acid. The more stable the cation is\nrelative to the amine, more basic is the amine. (a)Alkanamines versus ammonia\nLet us consider the reaction of an alkanamine and ammonia with\na proton to compare their basicity. Due to the electron releasing nature of alkyl group, it pushes\nelectrons towards nitrogen and thus makes the unshared electron\npair more available for sharing with the proton of the acid. Moreover,\nthe substituted ammonium ion formed from the amine gets stabilised\ndue to dispersal of the positive charge by the +I effect of the alkyl\ngroup. Hence, alkylamines are stronger bases than ammonia. Thus, the basic nature of aliphatic amines should increase with\nincrease in the number of alkyl groups. This trend is followed in\nthe gaseous phase. The order of basicity of amines in the gaseous\nphase follows the expected order: tertiary amine > secondary amine\n> primary amine > NH . The trend is not regular in the aqueous\nstate as evident by th3 eir pK values given in Table 9.3. In the\nb\naqueous phase, the substituted ammonium cations get stabilised\nnot only by electron releasing effect of the alkyl group (+I) but also\nby solvation with water molecules. The greater the size of the ion,\nlesser will be the solvation and the less stabilised is the ion. The\norder of stability of ions are as follows:\nDecreasing order of extent of H-bonding in water and order of\nstability of ions by solvation. Chemistry 268\nReprint 2025-26\nGreater is the stability of the substituted ammonium cation, stronger\nshould be the corresponding amine as a base. Thus, the order of basicity\nof aliphatic amines should be: primary > secondary > tertiary, which\nis opposite to the inductive effect based order. Secondly, when the\nalkyl group is small, like –CH group, there is no steric hindrance to\n3\nH-bonding. In case the alkyl group is bigger than CH group, there will\n3\nbe steric hinderance to H-bonding. Therefore, the change of nature of\nthe alkyl group, e.g., from –CH to –C H results in change of the order\n3 2 5\nof basic strength.", "Thus, there is a subtle interplay of the inductive\neffect, solvation effect and steric hinderance of the alkyl group which\ndecides the basic strength of alkyl amines in the aqueous state. The\norder of basic strength in case of methyl substituted amines and ethyl\nsubstituted amines in aqueous solution is as follows:\n(C H ) NH > (C H ) N > C H NH > NH\n2 5 2 2 5 3 2 5 2 3\n(CH ) NH > CH NH > (CH ) N > NH\n3 2 3 2 3 3 3\n(b) Arylamines versus ammonia\npK value of aniline is quite high. Why is it so? It is because in\nb\naniline or other arylamines, the -NH group is attached directly to\n2\nthe benzene ring. It results in the unshared electron pair on nitrogen\natom to be in conjugation with the benzene ring and thus making\nit less available for protonation. If you write different resonating\nstructures of aniline, you will find that aniline is a resonance\nhybrid of the following five structures. On the other hand, anilinium ion obtained by accepting a proton\ncan have only two resonating structures (kekule). We know that greater the number of resonating structures, greater\nis the stability. Thus you can infer that aniline (five resonating\nstructures) is more stable than anilinium ion. Hence, the proton\nacceptability or the basic nature of aniline or other aromatic amines\nwould be less than that of ammonia. In case of substituted aniline, it\nis observed that electron releasing groups like –OCH , –CH increase\n3 3\nbasic strength whereas electron withdrawing groups like –NO , –SO H,\n2 3\n–COOH, –X decrease it. 269 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nEEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 99999.....44444\nArrange the following in decreasing order of their basic strength:\nC H NH , C H NH , (C H ) NH, NH\n6 5 2 2 5 2 2 52 3\nSSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The decreasing order of basic strength of the above amines and ammonia\nfollows the following order:\n(C H ) NH > C H NH > NH > C H NH\n2 52 2 5 2 3 6 5 2\n2.Alkylation\nAmines undergo alkylation on reaction with alkyl halides (refer Unit\n6, Class XII). 3.Acylation\nAliphatic and aromatic primary and secondary amines react with\nacid chlorides, anhydrides and esters by nucleophilic substitution\nreaction. This reaction is known as acylation. You can consider\nthis reaction as the replacement of hydrogen atom of –NH or >N–H\n2\ngroup by the acyl group. The products obtained by acylation reaction\nare known as amides. The reaction is carried out in the presence of\na base stronger than the amine, like pyridine, which removes HCl so\nformed and shifts the equilibrium to the right hand side. Amines also react with benzoyl chloride (C H COCl). This reaction\n6 5\nis known as benzoylation. CH NH  C H COCl  CH NHCOC H HCl\n3 2 6 5 3 6 5\nMethanamine Benzoyl chloride NMethylbenzamide\nWhat do you think is the product of the reaction of amines with\ncarboxylic acids ? They form salts with amines at room temperature. Chemistry 270\nReprint 2025-26\n4.", "Carbylamine reaction\nAliphatic and aromatic primary amines on heating with chloroform\nand ethanolic potassium hydroxide form isocyanides or carbylamines\nwhich are foul smelling substances. Secondary and tertiary amines\ndo not show this reaction. This reaction is known as carbylamine\nreaction or isocyanide test and is used as a test for primary amines. 5. Reaction with nitrous acid\nThree classes of amines react differently with nitrous acid which is\nprepared in situ from a mineral acid and sodium nitrite. (a) Primary aliphatic amines react with nitrous acid to form aliphatic\ndiazonium salts which being unstable, liberate nitrogen gas\nquantitatively and alcohols. Quantitative evolution of nitrogen is\nused in estimation of amino acids and proteins. (b) Aromatic amines react with nitrous acid at low temperatures\n(273-278 K) to form diazonium salts, a very important class of\ncompounds used for synthesis of a variety of aromatic compounds\ndiscussed in Section 9.7. Secondary and tertiary amines react with nitrous acid in a\ndifferent manner. 6. Reaction with arylsulphonyl chloride\nBenzenesulphonyl chloride (C H SO Cl), which is also known as\n6 5 2\nHinsberg’s reagent, reacts with primary and secondary amines to\nform sulphonamides. (a)The reaction of benzenesulphonyl chloride with primary amine\nyields N-ethylbenzenesulphonyl amide. The hydrogen attached to nitrogen in sulphonamide is strongly\nacidic due to the presence of strong electron withdrawing sulphonyl\ngroup. Hence, it is soluble in alkali. (b) In the reaction with secondary amine, N,N-diethyl-\nbenzenesulphonamide is formed. O O\nS Cl + H N C H S N C H + HCl\n2 5 2 5\nO C H O C H\n2 5 2 5\nN,N-Diethylbenzenesulphonamide\n271 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nSince N, N-diethylbenzene sulphonamide does not contain any\nhydrogen atom attached to nitrogen atom, it is not acidic and hence\ninsoluble in alkali. (c) Tertiary amines do not react with benzenesulphonyl chloride. This property of amines reacting with benzenesulphonyl chloride\nin a different manner is used for the distinction of primary,\nsecondary and tertiary amines and also for the separation of a\nmixture of amines. However, these days benzenesulphonyl\nchloride is replaced by p-toluenesulphonyl chloride. 7. Electrophilic substitution\nYou have read earlier that aniline is a resonance hybrid of five\nstructures. Where do you find the maximum electron density in\nthese structures? Ortho- and para-positions to the –NH group\n2\nbecome centres of high electron density. Thus –NH group is ortho\n2\nand para directing and a powerful activating group. (a) Bromination: Aniline reacts with bromine water at room\ntemperature to give a white precipitate of 2,4,6-tribromoaniline. The main problem encountered during electrophilic substitution\nreactions of aromatic amines is that of their very high reactivity. Substitution tends to occur at ortho- and para-positions. If we\nhave to prepare monosubstituted aniline derivative, how can\nthe activating effect of –NH group be controlled ?", "This can be\n2\ndone by protecting the -NH group by acetylation with acetic\n2\nanhydride, then carrying out the desired substitution followed\nby hydrolysis of the substituted amide to the substituted amine. The lone pair of electrons on nitrogen of acetanilide interacts\nwith oxygen atom due to resonance as shown below:\nChemistry 272\nReprint 2025-26\nHence, the lone pair of electrons on nitrogen is less available for\ndonation to benzene ring by resonance. Therefore, activating\neffect of –NHCOCH group is less than that of amino group. 3\n(b) Nitration: Direct nitration of aniline yields tarry oxidation\nproducts in addition to the nitro derivatives. Moreover, in the\nstrongly acidic medium, aniline is protonated to form the\nanilinium ion which is meta directing. That is why besides the\northo and para derivatives, significant amount of meta derivative\nis also formed. However, by protecting the –NH group by acetylation reaction\n2\nwith acetic anhydride, the nitration reaction can be controlled\nand the p-nitro derivative can be obtained as the major product. (c) Sulphonation: Aniline reacts with concentrated sulphuric acid\nto form anilinium hydrogensulphate which on heating with\nsulphuric acid at 453-473K produces p-aminobenzene sulphonic\nacid, commonly known as sulphanilic acid, as the major product. Aniline does not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction (alkylation and\nacetylation) due to salt formation with aluminium chloride, the\nLewis acid, which is used as a catalyst. Due to this, nitrogen of\naniline acquires positive charge and hence acts as a strong\ndeactivating group for further reaction. 273 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nIIIIInnnnnttttteeeeexxxxxttttt QQQQQuuuuueeeeessssstttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n9.4 Arrange the following in increasing order of their basic strength:\n(i) C H NH , C H NH , NH , C H CH NH and (C H ) NH\n2 5 2 6 5 2 3 6 5 2 2 2 5 2\n(ii) C H NH , (C H ) NH, (C H ) N, C H NH\n2 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 3 6 5 2\n(iii) CH NH , (CH ) NH, (CH ) N, C H NH , C H CH NH . 3 2 32 33 6 5 2 6 5 2 2\n9.5 Complete the following acid-base reactions and name the products:\n(i) CH CH CH NH + HCl fi (ii) (C H ) N + HCl fi\n3 2 2 2 2 5 3\n9.6 Write reactions of the final alkylation product of aniline with excess of methyl\niodide in the presence of sodium carbonate solution. 9.7 Write chemical reaction of aniline with benzoyl chloride and write the name of\nthe product obtained. 9.8 Write structures of different isomers corresponding to the molecular formula,\nC H N.

DIAZONIUM SALTS\n –\nThe diazonium salts have the general formula RN X where R stands\n2\nfor an aryl group and X– ion may be Cl– Br,– HSO, BF, etc. They are\n4 4\nnamed by suffixing diazonium to the name of the parent hydrocarbon\nfrom which they are formed, followed by the name of anion such as\n\nchloride, hydrogensulphate, etc. The N group is called diazonium\n2\n –\ngroup.", "For example, C H N Cl is named as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2\nchloride and C H N +HSO – is known as benzenediazonium\n6 5 2 4\nhydrogensulphate. Primary aliphatic amines form highly unstable alkyldiazonium salts\n(refer to Section 9.6). Primary aromatic amines form arenediazonium\nsalts which are stable for a short time in solution at low temperatures\n(273-278 K). The stability of arenediazonium ion is explained on the\nbasis of resonance. 99999.....77777 MMMMMeeeeettttthhhhhoooooddddd ooooofffff Benzenediazonium chloride is prepared by the reaction of aniline with\nnitrous acid at 273-278K.

A. Reactions involving displacement of nitrogen\nDiazonium group being a very good leaving group, is substituted\nby other groups such as Cl–, Br– I– CN– and OH– which displace\n, ,\nnitrogen from the aromatic ring. The nitrogen formed escapes from\nthe reaction mixture as a gas. 1. Replacement by halide or cyanide ion: The Cl–, Br– and CN–\nnucleophiles can easily be introduced in the benzene ring in the\npresence of Cu(I) ion. This reaction is called Sandmeyer reaction. 2 2\n2 2\nAlternatively, chlorine or bromine can also be introduced in the\nbenzene ring by treating the diazonium salt solution with corresponding\nhalogen acid in the presence of copper powder. This is referred as\nGatterman reaction. The yield in Sandmeyer reaction is found to be better than\nGattermann reaction. 2. Replacement by iodide ion: Iodine is not easily introduced into\nthe benzene ring directly, but, when the diazonium salt solution\nis treated with potassium iodide, iodobenzene is formed. 3. Replacement by fluoride ion: When arenediazonium chloride is\ntreated with fluoroboric acid, arene diazonium fluoroborate is\nprecipitated which on heating decomposes to yield aryl fluoride. 4.", "Replacement by H: Certain mild reducing agents like\nhypophosphorous acid (phosphinic acid) or ethanol reduce\ndiazonium salts to arenes and themselves get oxidised to\nphosphorous acid and ethanal, respectively. 275 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\n5. Replacement by hydroxyl group: If the temperature of the\ndiazonium salt solution is allowed to rise upto 283 K, the salt\ngets hydrolysed to phenol. 6. Replacement by –NO group: When diazonium fluoroborate is\n2\nheated with aqueous sodium nitrite solution in the presence of\ncopper, the diazonium group is replaced by –NO group. 2\nB. Reactions involving retention of diazo group\ncoupling reactions\nThe azo products obtained have an extended conjugate system having\nboth the aromatic rings joined through the –N=N– bond. These compounds\nare often coloured and are used as dyes. Benzene diazonium chloride\nreacts with phenol in which the phenol molecule at its para position is\ncoupled with the diazonium salt to formp-hydroxyazobenzene. This\ntype of reaction is known as coupling reaction. Similarly the reaction of\ndiazonium salt with aniline yields p-aminoazobenzene. This is an example\nof electrophilic substitution reaction. 99999.....1111100000 IIIIImmmmmpppppooooorrrrrtttttaaaaannnnnccccceeeee From the above reactions, it is clear that the diazonium salts are very\ngood intermediates for the introduction of –F, –Cl, –Br, –I, –CN, –OH,\nooooofffff DDDDDiiiiiaaaaazzzzzooooonnnnniiiiiuuuuummmmm\n–NO groups into the aromatic ring.

SSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAmines can be considered as derivatives of ammonia obtained by replacement of\nhydrogen atoms with alkyl or aryl groups. Replacement of one hydrogen atom of\nammonia gives rise to structure of the type R-NH , known as primary amine. 2\nSecondary amines are characterised by the structure R NH or R-NHR¢¢¢¢¢ and tertiary\n2\namines by R N, RNR¢¢¢¢¢R¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢¢ or R NR¢¢¢¢¢..... Secondary and tertiary amines are known as\n3 2\nsimple amines if the alkyl or aryl groups are the same and mixed amines if the\ngroups are different.", "Like ammonia, all the three types of amines have one unshared\nelectron pair on nitrogen atom due to which they behave as Lewis bases. Amines are usually formed from nitro compounds, halides, amides, imides, etc. They exhibit hydrogen bonding which influence their physical properties. In\nalkylamines, a combination of electron releasing, steric and H-bonding factors\ninfluence the stability of the substituted ammonium cations in protic polar solvents\nand thus affect the basic nature of amines. Alkyl amines are found to be stronger\nbases than ammonia. In aromatic amines, electron releasing and withdrawing groups,\nrespectively increase and decrease their basic character. Aniline is a weaker base\n277 Amines\nReprint 2025-26\nthan ammonia. Reactions of amines are governed by availability of the unshared pair\nof electrons on nitrogen. Influence of the number of hydrogen atoms at nitrogen atom\non the type of reactions and nature of products is responsible for identification and\ndistinction between primary, secondary and tertiary amines. p-Toluenesulphonyl chloride\nis used for the identification of primary, secondary and tertiary amines. Presence of\namino group in aromatic ring enhances reactivity of the aromatic amines. Reactivity of\naromatic amines can be controlled by acylation process, i.e., by treating with acetyl\nchloride or acetic anhydride. Tertiary amines like trimethylamine are used as insect\nattractants. Aryldiazonium salts, usually obtained from arylamines, undergo replacement of\nthe diazonium group with a variety of nucleophiles to provide advantageous methods\nfor producing aryl halides, cyanides, phenols and arenes by reductive removal of the\ndiazo group. Coupling reaction of aryldiazonium salts with phenols or arylamines give\nrise to the formation of azo dyes.
