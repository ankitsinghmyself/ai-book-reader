["6\nChapter\nAPPLICATION OF\nDERIVATIVES\nv\nWith the Calculus as a key, Mathematics can be successfully applied\nto the explanation of the course of Nature.” — WHITEHEAD\nv\n6.1 Introduction\nIn Chapter 5, we have learnt how to find derivative of composite functions, inverse\ntrigonometric functions, implicit functions, exponential functions and logarithmic functions. In this chapter, we will study applications of the derivative in various disciplines, e.g., in\nengineering, science, social science, and many other fields. For instance, we will learn\nhow the derivative can be used (i) to determine rate of change of quantities, (ii) to find\nthe equations of tangent and normal to a curve at a point, (iii) to find turning points on\nthe graph of a function which in turn will help us to locate points at which largest or\nsmallest value (locally) of a function occurs. We will also use derivative to find intervals\non which a function is increasing or decreasing. Finally, we use the derivative to find\napproximate value of certain quantities. 6.2 Rate of Change of Quantities\nds\nRecall that by the derivative , we mean the rate of change of distance s with\ndt\nrespect to the time t. In a similar fashion, whenever one quantity y varies with another\ndy\nquantity x, satisfying some rule y= f(x), then (or f′(x)) represents the rate of\ndx\ndyø\nchange of y with respect to x and dxß œ (or f′(x )) represents the rate of change\nx=x0 0\nof y with respect to x at x= x . 0\nFurther, if two variables x and y are varying with respect to another variable t, i.e.,\nif x= f(t)and y= g(t), then by Chain Rule\ndy dy dx dx\n= , if „ 0\ndx dt dt dt\nReprint 2025-26\n148 MATHEMATICS\nThus, the rate of change of y with respect to x can be calculated using the rate of\nchange of y and that of x both with respect to t. Let us consider some examples. Example 1 Find the rate of change of the area of a circle per second with respect to\nits radius r when r = 5 cm. Solution The area A of a circle with radius r is given by A = πr2. Therefore, the rate\ndA d\nof change of the area A with respect to its radius r is given by = (πr2)=2πr. dr dr\ndA\nWhen r = 5 cm, =10π. Thus, the area of the circle is changing at the rate of\ndr\n10π cm2/s. Example 2 The volume of a cube is increasing at a rate of 9 cubic centimetres per\nsecond. How fast is the surface area increasing when the length of an edge is 10\ncentimetres ? Solution Let x be the length of a side, V be the volume and S be the surface area of\nthe cube. Then, V = x3 and S = 6x2, where x is a function of time t. dV\nNow = 9cm3/s (Given)\ndt\ndV d d dx\nTherefore 9 = = (x3)= (x3)⋅ (By Chain Rule)\ndt dt dx dt\ndx\n=\n3x2⋅\ndt\ndx 3\nor = ...

Consider the function f given by f(x) = x2, x ˛ R. The graph of this function is a\nparabola as given in Fig 6.1.", "Values left to origin Values right to origin\nx f (x) = x2 x f (x) = x2\n–2 4 0 0\n3 9 1 1\n\n2 4 2 4\n–1 1 1 1\n1 1 3 9\n\n2 4 2 4\n0 0 2 4\nas we move from left to right, the as we move from left to right, the\nheight of the graph decreases height of the graph increases\nFig 6.1\nFirst consider the graph (Fig 6.1) to the right of the origin. Observe that as we\nmove from left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously increases. For this reason, the function is said to be increasing for the real numbers x > 0. Now consider the graph to the left of the origin and observe here that as we move\nfrom left to right along the graph, the height of the graph continuously decreases. Consequently, the function is said to be decreasing for the real numbers x < 0. We shall now give the following analytical definitions for a function which is\nincreasing or decreasing on an interval. Definition 1 Let I be an interval contained in the domain of a real valued function f. Then f is said to be\n(i) increasing on I if x < x in I (cid:222) f(x ) < f(x ) for all x , x ˛ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2\n(ii) decreasing on I, if x < x in I (cid:222) f(x ) > f(x ) for all x , x ˛ I. 1 2 1 2 1 2\n(iii) constant on I, if f(x) = c for all x ˛ I, where c is a constant.

Strictly Increasing function Strictly Decreasing function Neither Increasing nor\nDecreasing function\n(i) (ii)\n(iii)\nFig 6.2\nWe shall now define when a function is increasing or decreasing at a point. Definition 2 Let x be a point in the domain of definition of a real valued function f. 0\nThen f is said to be increasing, decreasing at x if there exists an open interval I\n0\ncontaining x such that f is increasing, decreasing, respectively, in I. 0\nLet us clarify this definition for the case of increasing function. Example 7 Show that the function given by f(x) = 7x – 3 is increasing on R. Solution Let x and x be any two numbers in R. Then\n1 2\nx < x (cid:222) 7x < 7x (cid:222) 7x – 3 < 7x – 3 (cid:222) f(x ) < f(x )\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nThus, by Definition 1, it follows that f is strictly increasing on R. We shall now give the first derivative test for increasing and decreasing functions. The proof of this test requires the Mean Value Theorem studied in Chapter 5. Theorem 1 Let f be continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on the open interval\n(a,b). Then\n(a) f is increasing in [a,b] if f¢(x) > 0 for each x ˛ (a, b)\n(b) f is decreasing in [a,b] if f¢(x) < 0 for each x ˛ (a, b)\n(c) f is a constant function in [a,b] if f¢(x) = 0 for each x ˛ (a, b)\nReprint 2025-26\n154 MATHEMATICS\nProof (a) Let x , x ˛ [a, b] be such that x < x .", "1 2 1 2\nThen, by Mean Value Theorem (Theorem 8 in Chapter 5), there exists a point c\nbetween x and x such that\n1 2\nf(x ) – f(x ) = f¢(c) (x – x )\n2 1 2 1\ni.e. f(x ) – f(x ) > 0 (as f¢(c) > 0 (given))\n2 1\ni.e. f(x ) > f(x )\n2 1\nThus, we have\nx  x  f(x ) f(x ), forall x ,x [a,b]\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nHence, f is an increasing function in [a,b]. The proofs of part (b) and (c) are similar. It is left as an exercise to the reader. Remarks\nThere is a more generalised theorem, which states that if f¢(x) > 0 for x in an interval\nexcluding the end points and f is continuous in the interval, then f is increasing. Similarly,\nif f¢(x) < 0 for x in an interval excluding the end points and f is continuous in the\ninterval, then f is decreasing. Example 8 Show that the function f given by\nf(x) =x3 – 3x2 + 4x, x ˛ R\nis increasing on R. Solution Note that\nf¢(x) =3x2 – 6x + 4\n=3(x2 – 2x + 1) + 1\n=3(x – 1)2 + 1 > 0, in every interval of R\nTherefore, the function f is increasing on R.

Reprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 155\nSolution Note that f′(x) = – sin x\n(a) Since for each x ∈ (0, π), sin x > 0, we have f′(x) < 0 and so f is decreasing in\n(0, π). (b) Since for each x ∈ (π, 2π), sin x < 0, we have f′(x) > 0 and so f is increasing in\n(π, 2π). (c) Clearly by (a) and (b) above, f is neither increasing nor decreasing in (0, 2π). Example 10 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f(x) = x2 – 4x + 6 is\n(a) increasing (b) decreasing\nSolution We have\nf(x) = x2 – 4x + 6\nFig 6.3\nor f′(x) = 2x – 4\nTherefore, f′(x) = 0 gives x = 2. Now the point x = 2 divides the real line into two\ndisjoint intervals namely, (– ∞, 2) and (2, ∞) (Fig 6.3). In the interval (– ∞, 2), f′(x) = 2x\n– 4 < 0. Therefore, f is decreasing in this interval. Also, in the interval (2,¥ ), f¢ (x)>0\nand so the function f is increasing in this interval. Example 11 Find the intervals in which the function f given by f (x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x\n+ 30 is (a) increasing (b) decreasing. Solution We have\nf(x) = 4x3 – 6x2 – 72x + 30\nor f′(x) = 12x2 – 12x – 72\n= 12(x2 – x – 6)\n= 12(x – 3) (x + 2)\nTherefore, f′(x) = 0 gives x = – 2, 3. The\npoints x = – 2 and x = 3 divides the real line into\nthree disjoint intervals, namely, (– ∞, – 2), (– 2, 3) Fig 6.4\nand (3, ∞). Reprint 2025-26\n156 MATHEMATICS\nIn the intervals (– ∞, – 2) and (3, ∞), f′(x) is positive while in the interval (– 2, 3),\nf′(x) is negative.

In fact, we will find the ‘turning points’ of the\ngraph of a function and thus find points at which the graph reaches its highest (or\nReprint 2025-26\n160 MATHEMATICS\nlowest) locally. The knowledge of such points is very useful in sketching the graph of\na given function. Further, we will also find the absolute maximum and absolute minimum\nof a function that are necessary for the solution of many applied problems. Let us consider the following problems that arise in day to day life. (i) The profit from a grove of orange trees is given by P(x) = ax + bx2, where a,b\nare constants and x is the number of orange trees per acre. How many trees per\nacre will maximise the profit? (ii) A ball, thrown into the air from a building 60 metres high, travels along a path\nx2\ngiven by h(x)=60+x- , where x is the horizontal distance from the building\n60\nand h(x) is the height of the ball . What is the maximum height the ball will\nreach? (iii) An Apache helicopter of enemy is flying along the path given by the curve\nf (x) = x2 + 7. A soldier, placed at the point (1, 2), wants to shoot the helicopter\nwhen it is nearest to him. What is the nearest distance? In each of the above problem, there is something common, i.e., we wish to find out\nthe maximum or minimum values of the given functions. In order to tackle such problems,\nwe first formally define maximum or minimum values of a function, points of local\nmaxima and minima and test for determining such points. Definition 3 Let f be a function defined on an interval I.", "Then\n(a) f is said to have a maximum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that\nf(c)> f(x), for all x ∈ I. The number f(c) is called the maximum value of f in I and the point c is called a\npoint of maximum value of f in I. (b) f is said to have a minimum value in I, if there exists a point c in I such that\nf(c) < f(x), for all x ∈ I. The number f(c), in this case, is called the minimum value of f in I and the point\nc, in this case, is called a point of minimum value of f in I. (c) f is said to have an extreme value in I if there exists a point c in I such that\nf (c) is either a maximum value or a minimum value of f in I. The number f(c), in this case, is called an extreme value of f in I and the point c\nis called an extreme point. Remark In Fig 6.7(a), (b) and (c), we have exhibited that graphs of certain particular\nfunctions help us to find maximum value and minimum value at a point. Infact, through\ngraphs, we can even find maximum/minimum value of a function at a point at which it\nis not even differentiable (Example 15).

Solution From the graph of the given function (Fig 6.8), we\nhave f(x) = 0 if x = 0. Also\nf(x) ≥0, for all x ∈ R. Therefore, the minimum value of f is 0 and the point of\nminimum value of f is x = 0. Further, it may be observed\nfrom the graph of the function that f has no maximum value\nand hence no point of maximum value of f in R. A Fig 6.8\nNote If we restrict the domain of f to [– 2, 1] only,\nthen f will have maximum value(– 2)2 = 4 at x = – 2. Example 15 Find the maximum and minimum values\nof f , if any, of the function given by f(x) = |x|, x ∈ R. Solution From the graph of the given function\n(Fig 6.9) , note that\nf(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and f(x) = 0 if x = 0. Therefore, the function f has a minimum value 0\nand the point of minimum value of f is x = 0. Also, the\ngraph clearly shows that f has no maximum value in R\nand hence no point of maximum value in R.

Reprint 2025-26\n162 MATHEMATICS\n(ii) One may note that the function f in Example 27 is not differentiable at\nx = 0. Example 16 Find the maximum and the minimum values, if any, of the function\ngiven by\nf(x) = x, x ∈ (0, 1). Solution The given function is an increasing (strictly) function in the given interval\n(0, 1). From the graph (Fig 6.10) of the function f , it\nseems that, it should have the minimum value at a\npoint closest to 0 on its right and the maximum value\nat a point closest to 1 on its left. Are such points\navailable? Of course, not. It is not possible to locate\nsuch points. Infact, if a point x is closest to 0, then\n0\nx\nwe find 0 < x for all x ˛ (0,1). Also, if x is closest\n2 0 0 1\nx +1\nto 1, then 1 > x for all x ˛ (0,1).", "2 1 1\nFig 6.10\nTherefore, the given function has neither the\nmaximum value nor the minimum value in the interval (0,1). Remark The reader may observe that in Example 16, if we include the points 0 and 1\nin the domain of f , i.e., if we extend the domain of f to [0,1], then the function f has\nminimum value 0 at x = 0 and maximum value 1 at x = 1. Infact, we have the following\nresults (The proof of these results are beyond the scope of the present text)\nEvery monotonic function assumes its maximum/minimum value at the end\npoints of the domain of definition of the function. A more general result is\nEvery continuous function on a closed interval has a maximum and a minimum\nvalue. A\nNote By a monotonic function f in an interval I, we mean that f is either\nincreasing in I or decreasing in I. Maximum and minimum values of a function defined on a closed interval will be\ndiscussed later in this section. Let us now examine the graph of a function as shown in Fig 6.11. Observe that at\npoints A, B, C and D on the graph, the function changes its nature from decreasing to\nincreasing or vice-versa. These points may be called turning points of the given\nfunction. Further, observe that at turning points, the graph has either a little hill or a little\nvalley. Roughly speaking, the function has minimum value in some neighbourhood\n(interval) of each of the points A and C which are at the bottom of their respective\nReprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 163\nFig 6.11\nvalleys. Similarly, the function has maximum value in some neighbourhood of points B\nand D which are at the top of their respective hills. For this reason, the points A and C\nmay be regarded as points of local minimum value (or relative minimum value) and\npoints B and D may be regarded as points of local maximum value (or relative maximum\nvalue) for the function. The local maximum value and local minimum value of the\nfunction are referred to as local maxima and local minima, respectively, of the function. We now formally give the following definition\nDefinition 4 Let f be a real valued function and let c be an interior point in the domain\nof f. Then\n(a) c is called a point of local maxima if there is an h > 0 such that\nf(c) ≥ f(x), for all x in (c – h, c + h), x ≠ c\nThe value f(c) is called the local maximum value of f. (b) c is called a point of local minima if there is an h > 0 such that\nf(c) ≤ f(x), for all x in (c – h, c + h)\nThe value f(c) is called the local minimum value of f . Geometrically, the above definition states that if x = c is a point of local maxima of f,\nthen the graph of f around c will be as shown in Fig 6.12(a). Note that the function f is\nincreasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the\ninterval (c, c + h). This suggests that f′(c) must be zero. Fig 6.12\nReprint 2025-26\n164 MATHEMATICS\nSimilarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then the graph of f around c will be as\nshown in Fig 6.14(b).", "Here f is decreasing (i.e., f′(x) < 0) in the interval (c – h, c) and\nincreasing (i.e., f′(x) > 0) in the interval (c, c + h). This again suggest that f′(c) must\nbe zero. The above discussion lead us to the following theorem (without proof). Theorem 2 Let f be a function defined on an open interval I. Suppose c ∈ I be any\npoint. If f has a local maxima or a local minima at x = c, then either f′(c) = 0 or f is not\ndifferentiable at c. Remark The converse of above theorem need not\nbe true, that is, a point at which the derivative vanishes\nneed not be a point of local maxima or local minima. For example, if f(x) = x3, then f ′(x) = 3x2 and so\nf ′(0) = 0. But 0 is neither a point of local maxima nor\na point of local minima (Fig 6.13). A\nNote A point c in the domain of a function f at\nwhich either f′(c) = 0 or f is not differentiable is\ncalled a critical point of f. Note that if f is continuous\nat c and f′(c) = 0, then there exists an h > 0 such\nthat f is differentiable in the interval\nFig 6.13\n(c – h, c + h). We shall now give a working rule for finding points of local maxima or points of\nlocal minima using only the first order derivatives. Theorem 3 (First Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an open interval I. Let f be continuous at a critical point c in I. Then\n(i) If f′(x) changes sign from positive to negative as x increases through c, i.e., if\nf′(x) > 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) < 0 at\nevery point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local\nmaxima. (ii) If f′(x) changes sign from negative to positive as x increases through c, i.e., if\nf′(x) < 0 at every point sufficiently close to and to the left of c, and f′(x) > 0 at\nevery point sufficiently close to and to the right of c, then c is a point of local\nminima. (iii) If f′(x) does not change sign as x increases through c, then c is neither a point of\nlocal maxima nor a point of local minima. Infact, such a point is called point of\ninflection (Fig 6.13). Reprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 165\nA\nNote If c is a point of local maxima of f , then f(c) is a local maximum value of\nf. Similarly, if c is a point of local minima of f , then f(c) is a local minimum value of f. Figures 6.13 and 6.14, geometrically explain Theorem 3. Fig 6.14\nExample 17 Find all points of local maxima and local minima of the function f\ngiven by\nf(x) =x3 – 3x + 3. Solution We have\nf(x) =x3 – 3x + 3\nor f′(x) = 3x2 – 3 = 3(x – 1) (x + 1)\nor f′(x) =0 at x = 1 and x = – 1\nThus, x = ± 1 are the only critical points which could possibly be the points of local\nmaxima and/or local minima of f . Let us first examine the point x = 1. Note that for values close to 1 and to the right of 1, f′(x) > 0 and for values close\nto 1 and to the left of 1, f′(x) < 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = 1 is a point\nof local minima and local minimum value is f(1) = 1.", "In the case of x = –1, note that\nf′(x) > 0, for values close to and to the left of –1 and f′(x) < 0, for values close to and\nto the right of – 1. Therefore, by first derivative test, x = – 1 is a point of local maxima\nand local maximum value is f(–1) = 5.

Solution We have\nf(x) = 2x3 – 6x2 + 6x + 5\nor f′(x) =6x2 – 12x + 6 = 6(x – 1)2\nor f′(x) =0 at x = 1\nThus, x = 1 is the only critical point of f . We shall now examine this point for local\nmaxima and/or local minima of f. Observe that f′(x) ≥ 0, for all x ∈ R and in particular\nf′(x) > 0, for values close to 1 and to the left and to the right of 1. Therefore, by first\nderivative test, the point x = 1 is neither a point of local maxima nor a point of local\nminima. Hence x = 1 is a point of inflexion. Remark One may note that since f′(x), in Example 30, never changes its sign on R,\ngraph of f has no turning points and hence no point of local maxima or local minima. We shall now give another test to examine local maxima and local minima of a\ngiven function. This test is often easier to apply than the first derivative test. Theorem 4 (Second Derivative Test) Let f be a function defined on an interval I\nand c ∈ I. Let f be twice differentiable at c. Then\n(i) x = c is a point of local maxima if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) < 0\nThe value f (c) is local maximum value of f . (ii) x = c is a point of local minima if f ¢ (c)=0 and f″(c) > 0\nIn this case, f (c) is local minimum value of f . (iii) The test fails if f′(c) = 0 and f″(c) = 0. In this case, we go back to the first derivative test and find whether c is a point of\nlocal maxima, local minima or a point of inflexion. A\nNote As f is twice differentiable at c, we mean\nsecond order derivative of f exists at c. Example 19 Find local minimum value of the function f\ngiven by f (x) = 3 + |x|, x ∈ R. Solution Note that the given function is not differentiable\nat x = 0. So, second derivative test fails. Let us try first\nderivative test. Note that 0 is a critical point of f . Now to\nFig 6.15\nthe left of 0, f(x) = 3 – x and so f′(x) = – 1 < 0. Also to\nReprint 2025-26\nAPPLICATION OF DERIVATIVES 167\nthe right of 0, f(x) = 3 + x and so f′(x) = 1 > 0. Therefore, by first derivative test, x =\n0 is a point of local minima of f and local minimum value of f is f (0) = 3. Example 20 Find local maximum and local minimum values of the function f given by\nf (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – 12x2 + 12\nSolution We have\nf (x) =3x4 + 4x3 – 12x2 + 12\nor f′(x) = 12x3 + 12x2 – 24x = 12x (x – 1) (x + 2)\nor f′(x) =0 at x = 0, x = 1 and x = – 2.", "Now f″(x) =36x2 + 24x – 24 = 12(3x2 + 2x – 2)\n(cid:236) f¢¢ (0) =- 2<4 0\n(cid:239)\n(cid:237) f¢¢ (1) = 36>0\nor\n(cid:239)\n(cid:238) f¢¢ -( 2=) 7>2 0\nTherefore, by second derivative test, x = 0 is a point of local maxima and local\nmaximum value of f at x = 0 is f (0) = 12 while x = 1 and x = – 2 are the points of local\nminima and local minimum values of f at x = – 1 and – 2 are f (1) = 7 and f (–2) = –20,\nrespectively. Example 21 Find all the points of local maxima and local minima of the function f\ngiven by\nf(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5. Solution We have\nf(x) =2x3 – 6x2 + 6x +5\nf′(x)=6x2 −12x+6=6(x−1)2\nor \nf′′(x)=12(x−1)\nNow f′(x) = 0 gives x =1. Also f″(1) = 0. Therefore, the second derivative test\nfails in this case. So, we shall go back to the first derivative test. We have already seen (Example 18) that, using first derivative test, x =1 is neither\na point of local maxima nor a point of local minima and so it is a point of inflexion. Example 22 Find two positive numbers whose sum is 15 and the sum of whose\nsquares is minimum. Solution Let one of the numbers be x. Then the other number is (15 – x).

Then RB = (20 – x) m (as AB = 20 m).", "From Fig 6.16,\nwe have\nRP2 = AR2 + AP2\nand RQ2 =RB2 + BQ2 Fig 6.16\nTherefore RP2 + RQ2 = AR2 + AP2 + RB2 + BQ2\n=x2 + (16)2 + (20 – x)2 + (22)2\n=2x2 – 40x + 1140\nLet S ≡ S(x) =RP2 + RQ2 = 2x2 – 40x + 1140. Therefore S′(x) =4x – 40. Now S′(x) = 0 gives x = 10. Also S″(x) = 4 > 0, for all x and so S″(10) > 0. Therefore, by second derivative test, x = 10 is the point of local minima of S.

Further, we may note that the function even has neither a\nlocal maximum value nor a local minimum value. However, if we extend the domain of f to the closed interval [0, 1], then f still may\nnot have a local maximum (minimum) values but it certainly does have maximum value\n3 = f(1) and minimum value 2 = f(0).", "The maximum value 3 of f at x = 1 is called\nabsolute maximum value (global maximum or greatest value) of f on the interval\n[0, 1]. Similarly, the minimum value 2 of f at x = 0 is called the absolute minimum\nvalue (global minimum or least value) of f on [0, 1]. Consider the graph given in Fig 6.19 of a continuous function defined on a closed\ninterval [a, d]. Observe that the function f has a local minima at x = b and local\nReprint 2025-26\n172 MATHEMATICS\nFig 6.19\nminimum value is f(b). The function also has a local maxima at x = c and local maximum\nvalue is f (c). Also from the graph, it is evident that f has absolute maximum value f(a) and\nabsolute minimum value f(d). Further note that the absolute maximum (minimum)\nvalue of f is different from local maximum (minimum) value of f. We will now state two results (without proof) regarding absolute maximum and\nabsolute minimum values of a function on a closed interval I. Theorem 5 Let f be a continuous function on an interval I = [a, b]. Then f has the\nabsolute maximum value and f attains it at least once in I. Also, f has the absolute\nminimum value and attains it at least once in I. Theorem 6 Let f be a differentiable function on a closed interval I and let c be any\ninterior point of I. Then\n(i) f′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute maximum value at c. (ii) f′(c) = 0 if f attains its absolute minimum value at c. In view of the above results, we have the following working rule for finding absolute\nmaximum and/or absolute minimum values of a function in a given closed interval\n[a, b]. Working Rule\nStep 1: Find all critical points of f in the interval, i.e., find points x where either\nf ¢ (x)=0 or f is not differentiable. Step 2: Take the end points of the interval. Step 3: At all these points (listed in Step 1 and 2), calculate the values of f . Step 4: Identify the maximum and minimum values of f out of the values calculated in\nStep 3. This maximum value will be the absolute maximum (greatest) value of\nf and the minimum value will be the absolute minimum (least) value of f .

Solution We have\nf(x) =2x3 – 15x2 + 36x + 1\nor f′(x) = 6x2 – 30x + 36 = 6(x – 3) (x – 2)\nNote that f′(x) = 0 gives x = 2 and x = 3. We shall now evaluate the value of f at these points and at the end points of the\ninterval [1, 5], i.e., at x = 1, x = 2, x = 3 and at x = 5. So\nf(1) = 2(13) – 15(12) + 36(1) + 1 = 24\nf(2) = 2(23) – 15(22) + 36(2) + 1 = 29\nf(3) = 2(33) – 15(32) + 36(3) + 1 = 28\nf(5) = 2(53) – 15(52) + 36(5) + 1 = 56\nThus, we conclude that absolute maximum value of f on [1, 5] is 56, occurring at\nx =5, and absolute minimum value of f on [1, 5] is 24 which occurs at x = 1.", "Example 28 Find absolute maximum and minimum values of a function f given by\n4 1\nf(x)=12x3 −6x3, x∈[−1,1]\nSolution We have\n4 1\nf(x) = 12x3 −6x3\n1\n2 2(8x−1)\nor f′(x) = 16x3 − =\n2 2\nx3 x3\n1\nThus, f′(x) = 0 gives x= .

A soldier, placed at (3, 7), wants to shoot down the helicopter when it is\nnearest to him. Find the nearest distance. Solution For each value of x, the helicopter’s position is at point (x, x2 + 7). Therefore, the distance between the helicopter and the soldier placed at (3,7) is\n(x- 3)2+ (x2+ 7- 7)2 , i.e., (x- 3)2+ x4 . Let f(x) = (x – 3)2 + x4\nor f ′(x) =2(x – 3) + 4x3 = 2(x – 1) (2x2 + 2x + 3)\nThus, f′(x) = 0 gives x = 1 or 2x2 + 2x + 3 = 0 for which there are no real roots. Also, there are no end points of the interval to be added to the set for which f′ is zero,\ni.e., there is only one point, namely, x = 1. The value of f at this point is given by\nf (1) = (1 – 3)2 + (1)4 = 5. Thus, the distance between the solider and the helicopter is\nf(1) = 5. Note that 5 is either a maximum value or a minimum value. Since\nf(0) = (0−3)2 +(0)4 =3> 5,\nit follows that 5 is the minimum value of f(x).
