["406 MATHEMATICS\n13\nChapter\nPROBABILITY\nvThe theory of probabilities is simply the Science of logic\nv\nquantitatively treated. – C.S. PEIRCE\n13.1 Introduction\nIn earlier Classes, we have studied the probability as a\nmeasure of uncertainty of events in a random experiment. We discussed the axiomatic approach formulated by\nRussian Mathematician, A.N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987)\nand treated probability as a function of outcomes of the\nexperiment. We have also established equivalence between\nthe axiomatic theory and the classical theory of probability\nin case of equally likely outcomes. On the basis of this\nrelationship, we obtained probabilities of events associated\nwith discrete sample spaces. We have also studied the\naddition rule of probability. In this chapter, we shall discuss\nthe important concept of conditional probability of an event\ngiven that another event has occurred, which will be helpful\nin understanding the Bayes' theorem, multiplication rule of\nPierre de Fermat\nprobability and independence of events. We shall also learn (1601-1665)\nan important concept of random variable and its probability\ndistribution and also the mean and variance of a probability distribution. In the last\nsection of the chapter, we shall study an important discrete probability distribution\ncalled Binomial distribution. Throughout this chapter, we shall take up the experiments\nhaving equally likely outcomes, unless stated otherwise. 13.2 Conditional Probability\nUptill now in probability, we have discussed the methods of finding the probability of\nevents. If we have two events from the same sample space, does the information\nabout the occurrence of one of the events affect the probability of the other event? Let\nus try to answer this question by taking up a random experiment in which the outcomes\nare equally likely to occur. Consider the experiment of tossing three fair coins. The sample space of the\nexperiment is\nS = {HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, HTT, THT, TTH, TTT}\nReprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 407\n1\nSince the coins are fair, we can assign the probability to each sample point. Let\n8\nE be the event ‘at least two heads appear’ and F be the event ‘first coin shows tail’. Then\nE ={HHH, HHT, HTH, THH}\nand F = {THH, THT, TTH, TTT}\nTherefore P(E) =P ({HHH}) + P ({HHT}) + P ({HTH}) + P ({THH})\n1 1 1 1 1\n= + + + = (Why ?)\n8 8 8 8 2\nand P(F) =P ({THH}) + P ({THT}) + P ({TTH}) + P ({TTT})\n1 1 1 1 1\n= + + + =\n8 8 8 8 2\nAlso E ∩ F ={THH}\n1\nwith P(E ∩ F) =P({THH}) =\n8\nNow, suppose we are given that the first coin shows tail, i.e. F occurs, then what is\nthe probability of occurrence of E? With the information of occurrence of F, we are\nsure that the cases in which first coin does not result into a tail should not be considered\nwhile finding the probability of E. This information reduces our sample space from the\nset S to its subset F for the event E.", "In other words, the additional information really\namounts to telling us that the situation may be considered as being that of a new\nrandom experiment for which the sample space consists of all those outcomes only\nwhich are favourable to the occurrence of the event F. Now, the sample point of F which is favourable to event E is THH. 1\nThus, Probability of E considering F as the sample space = ,\n4\n1\nor Probability of E given that the event F has occurred =\n4\nThis probability of the event E is called the conditional probability of E given\nthat F has already occurred, and is denoted by P (E|F). 1\nThus P(E|F) =\n4\nNote that the elements of F which favour the event E are the common elements of\nE and F, i.e. the sample points of E ∩ F. Reprint 2025-26\n408 MATHEMATICS\nThus, we can also write the conditional probability of E given that F has occurred as\nNumberofelementaryeventsfavourableto E∩F\nP(E|F) =\nNumberofelementaryeventswhicharefavourableto F\nn(E∩F)\n=\nn(F)\nDividing the numerator and the denominator by total number of elementary events\nof the sample space, we see that P(E|F) can also be written as\nn(E∩F)\nn(S) P(E∩F)\nP(E|F) = = ... (1)\nn(F) P(F)\nn(S)\nNote that (1) is valid only when P(F) ≠ 0 i.e., F ≠ φ (Why?)\nThus, we can define the conditional probability as follows :\nDefinition 1 If E and F are two events associated with the same sample space of a\nrandom experiment, the conditional probability of the event E given that F has occurred,\ni.e. P (E|F) is given by\nP(E∩F)\nP(E|F) = provided P(F) ≠ 0\nP(F)\n13.2.1 Properties of conditional probability\nLet E and F be events of a sample space S of an experiment, then we have\nProperty 1 P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1\nWe know that\nP(S∩F) P(F)\nP(S|F) = = =1\nP(F) P(F)\nP(F∩F) P(F)\nAlso P(F|F) = = =1\nP(F) P(F)\nThus P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1\nProperty 2 If A and B are any two events of a sample space S and F is an event\nof S such that P(F) ≠ 0, then\nP((A ∪ B)|F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A ∩ B)|F)\nReprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 409\nIn particular, if A and B are disjoint events, then\nP((A∪B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F)\nWe have\nP[(A∪B)∩F]\nP((A∪B)|F) =\nP(F)\nP[(A∩F) ∪ (B∩F)]\n=\nP(F)\n(by distributive law of union of sets over intersection)\nP(A∩F)+P(B∩F)–P(A∩B ∩ F)\n=\nP(F)\nP(A∩F) P(B∩F) P[(A∩B) ∩F]\n= + −\nP(F) P(F) P(F)\n=P(A|F) + P(B|F) – P((A∩B)|F)\nWhen A and B are disjoint events, then\nP((A ∩ B)|F) =0\n⇒ P((A ∪ B)|F) =P(A|F) + P(B|F)\nProperty 3 P(E′|F) = 1 − P(E|F)\nFrom Property 1, we know that P(S|F) = 1\n⇒ P(E ∪ E′|F) =1 since S = E ∪ E′\n⇒ P(E|F) + P (E′|F) =1 since E and E′ are disjoint events\nThus, P(E′|F) =1 − P(E|F)\nLet us now take up some examples. 7 9 4\nExample 1 If P(A) = , P(B) = and P(A ∩ B) = , evaluate P(A|B). 13 13 13\n4\nP(A∩B) 13 4\nSolution We have P(A|B)= = =\nP(B) 9 9\n13\nExample 2 A family has two children.

Clearly, the set E ∩ F\ndenotes the event that both E and F have occurred. In other words, E ∩ F denotes the\nsimultaneous occurrence of the events E and F. The event E ∩ F is also written as EF. Very often we need to find the probability of the event EF. For example, in the\nexperiment of drawing two cards one after the other, we may be interested in finding\nthe probability of the event ‘a king and a queen’. The probability of event EF is obtained\nby using the conditional probability as obtained below :\nWe know that the conditional probability of event E given that F has occurred is\ndenoted by P(E|F) and is given by\nP(E ∩F)\nP(E|F) = ,P(F)≠0\nP(F)\nFrom this result, we can write\nP(E ∩ F) =P(F) . P(E|F) ... (1)\nAlso, we know that\nP(F∩E)\nP(F|E) = ,P(E)≠0\nP(E)\nP(E ∩F)\nor P(F|E) = (since E ∩ F = F ∩ E)\nP(E)\nThus, P(E ∩ F) =P(E). P(F|E) .... (2)\nCombining (1) and (2), we find that\nP(E ∩ F) =P(E) P(F|E)\n=P(F) P(E|F) provided P(E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0. The above result is known as the multiplication rule of probability. Let us now take up an example. Example 8 An urn contains 10 black and 5 white balls. Two balls are drawn from the\nurn one after the other without replacement. What is the probability that both drawn\nballs are black? Solution Let E and F denote respectively the events that first and second ball drawn\nare black. We have to find P(E ∩ F) or P(EF).", "Reprint 2025-26\n416 MATHEMATICS\n10\nNow P(E) = P (black ball in first draw) =\n15\nAlso given that the first ball drawn is black, i.e., event E has occurred, now there\nare 9 black balls and five white balls left in the urn. Therefore, the probability that the\nsecond ball drawn is black, given that the ball in the first draw is black, is nothing but\nthe conditional probability of F given that E has occurred. 9\ni.e. P(F|E) =\n14\nBy multiplication rule of probability, we have\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) P(F|E)\n10 9 3\n= × =\n15 14 7\nMultiplication rule of probability for more than two events If E, F and G are\nthree events of sample space, we have\nP(E ∩ F ∩ G) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|(E ∩ F)) = P(E) P(F|E) P(G|EF)\nSimilarly, the multiplication rule of probability can be extended for four or\nmore events. The following example illustrates the extension of multiplication rule of probability\nfor three events. Example 9 Three cards are drawn successively, without replacement from a pack of\n52 well shuffled cards. What is the probability that first two cards are kings and the\nthird card drawn is an ace? Solution Let K denote the event that the card drawn is king and A be the event that\nthe card drawn is an ace. Clearly, we have to find P (KKA)\n4\nNow P(K) =\n52\nAlso, P(K|K) is the probability of second king with the condition that one king has\nalready been drawn. Now there are three kings in (52 − 1) = 51 cards. 3\nTherefore P(K|K) =\n51\nLastly, P(A|KK) is the probability of third drawn card to be an ace, with the condition\nthat two kings have already been drawn. Now there are four aces in left 50 cards. Reprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 417\n4\nTherefore P(A|KK) =\n50\nBy multiplication law of probability, we have\nP(KKA) =P(K) P(K|K) P(A|KK)\n4 3 4 2\n= × × =\n52 51 50 5525\n13.4 Independent Events\nConsider the experiment of drawing a card from a deck of 52 playing cards, in which\nthe elementary events are assumed to be equally likely. If E and F denote the events\n'the card drawn is a spade' and 'the card drawn is an ace' respectively, then\n13 1 4 1\nP(E) = = andP(F)= =\n52 4 52 13\nAlso E and F is the event ' the card drawn is the ace of spades' so that\n1\nP(E∩F) =\n52\n1\nP(E ∩F) 52 1\nHence P(E|F) = = =\nP(F) 1 4\n13\n1\nSince P(E) = = P (E|F), we can say that the occurrence of event F has not\n4\naffected the probability of occurrence of the event E. We also have\n1\nP(E ∩F) 52 1\nP(F|E) = = = =P(F)\nP(E) 1 13\n4\n1\nAgain, P(F) = = P(F|E) shows that occurrence of event E has not affected\n13\nthe probability of occurrence of the event F. Thus, E and F are two events such that the probability of occurrence of one of\nthem is not affected by occurrence of the other. Such events are called independent events. Reprint 2025-26\n418 MATHEMATICS\nDefinition 2 Two events E and F are said to be independent, if\nP(F|E) = P (F) provided P (E) ≠ 0\nand P(E|F) = P (E) provided P (F) ≠ 0\nThus, in this definition we need to have P (E) ≠ 0 and P(F) ≠ 0\nNow, by the multiplication rule of probability, we have\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) .", "P (F|E) ... (1)\nIf E and F are independent, then (1) becomes\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P(F) ... (2)\nThus, using (2), the independence of two events is also defined as follows:\nDefinition 3 Let E and F be two events associated with the same random experiment,\nthen E and F are said to be independent if\nP(E ∩ F) = P(E) . P (F)\nRemarks\n(i) Two events E and F are said to be dependent if they are not independent, i.e. if\nP(E ∩ F ) ≠ P(E) . P (F)\n(ii) Sometimes there is a confusion between independent events and mutually\nexclusive events. Term ‘independent’ is defined in terms of ‘probability of events’\nwhereas mutually exclusive is defined in term of events (subset of sample space). Moreover, mutually exclusive events never have an outcome common, but\nindependent events, may have common outcome. Clearly, ‘independent’ and\n‘mutually exclusive’ do not have the same meaning. In other words, two independent events having nonzero probabilities of occurrence\ncan not be mutually exclusive, and conversely, i.e. two mutually exclusive events\nhaving nonzero probabilities of occurrence can not be independent. (iii) Two experiments are said to be independent if for every pair of events E and F,\nwhere E is associated with the first experiment and F with the second experiment,\nthe probability of the simultaneous occurrence of the events E and F when the\ntwo experiments are performed is the product of P(E) and P(F) calculated\nseparately on the basis of two experiments, i.e., P (E ∩ F) = P (E) .

Example 10 A die is thrown. If E is the event ‘the number appearing is a multiple of\n3’ and F be the event ‘the number appearing is even’ then find whether E and F are\nindependent ? Solution We know that the sample space is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\nNow E = { 3, 6}, F = { 2, 4, 6} and E ∩ F = {6}\n2 1 3 1 1\nThen P(E) = = , P(F)= = and P(E∩ F)=\n6 3 6 2 6\nClearly P(E ∩ F) = P(E).

We can find the probability of selecting any of the bags (i.e. ) or probability of\n2\ndrawing a ball of a particular colour (say white) from a particular bag (say Bag I). In\nother words, we can find the probability that the ball drawn is of a particular colour, if\nwe are given the bag from which the ball is drawn. But, can we find the probability that\nthe ball drawn is from a particular bag (say Bag II), if the colour of the ball drawn is\ngiven? Here, we have to find the reverse probability of Bag II to be selected when an\nevent occurred after it is known.", "Famous mathematician, John Bayes' solved the problem\nof finding reverse probability by using conditional probability. The formula developed\nby him is known as ‘Bayes theorem’ which was published posthumously in 1763. Before stating and proving the Bayes' theorem, let us first take up a definition and\nsome preliminary results. 13.5.1 Partition of a sample space\nA set of events E , E , ..., E is said to represent a partition of the sample space S if\n1 2 n\n(a) E ∩ E = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, ..., n\ni j\nReprint 2025-26\n424 MATHEMATICS\n(b) E ∪ Ε ∪ ... ∪ E = S and\n1 2 n\n(c) P(E)>0 for all i = 1, 2, ..., n. i\nIn other words, the events E , E , ..., E represent a partition of the sample space\n1 2 n\nS if they are pairwise disjoint, exhaustive and have nonzero probabilities. As an example, we see that any nonempty event E and its complement E′ form a\npartition of the sample space S since they satisfy E ∩ E′ = φ and E ∪ E′ = S. From the Venn diagram in Fig 13.3, one can easily observe that if E and F are any\ntwo events associated with a sample space S, then the set {E ∩ F′, E ∩ F, E′ ∩ F, E′ ∩ F′}\nis a partition of the sample space S. It may be mentioned that the partition of a sample\nspace is not unique. There can be several partitions of the same sample space. We shall now prove a theorem known as Theorem of total probability. 13.5.2 Theorem of total probability\nLet {E , E ,...,E } be a partition of the sample space S, and suppose that each of the\n1 2 n\nevents E , E ,..., E has nonzero probability of occurrence. Let A be any event associated\n1 2 n\nwith S, then\nP(A) = P(E) P(A|E ) + P(E ) P(A|E ) + ... + P(E ) P(A|E )\n1 1 2 2 n n\nn\n∑\n= P(E )P(A|E )\nj j\nj=1\nProof Given that E, E ,..., E is a partition of the sample space S (Fig 13.4). Therefore,\n1 2 n\nS = E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E ... (1)\n1 2 n\nand E ∩ E = φ, i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n\ni j\nNow, we know that for any event A,\nA = A ∩ S\n=A ∩ (E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E )\n1 2 n\n=(A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E ) ∪ ...∪ (A ∩ E ) Fig 13.4\n1 2 n\nAlso A ∩ E and A ∩ E are respectively the subsets of E and E. We know that\ni j i j\nE and E are disjoint, for i≠ j, therefore, A ∩ E and A ∩ E are also disjoint for all\ni j i j\ni ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, ..., n. Thus, P(A) = P [(A ∩ E ) ∪ (A ∩ E )∪ .....∪ (A ∩ E )]\n1 2 n\n=P (A ∩ E ) + P (A ∩ E ) + ... + P (A ∩ E )\n1 2 n\nNow, by multiplication rule of probability, we have\nP(A ∩ E) = P(E) P(A|E) as P (E) ≠ 0∀i = 1,2,..., n\ni i i i\nReprint 2025-26\nPROBABILITY 425\nTherefore, P (A) =P (E ) P (A|E ) + P (E ) P (A|E ) + ... + P (E )P(A|E )\n1 1 2 2 n n\nn\n∑\nor P(A) = P(E )P(A|E )\nj j\nj=1\nExample 15 A person has undertaken a construction job. The probabilities are 0.65\nthat there will be strike, 0.80 that the construction job will be completed on time if there\nis no strike, and 0.32 that the construction job will be completed on time if there is a\nstrike. Determine the probability that the construction job will be completed on time.", "Solution Let A be the event that the construction job will be completed on time, and B\nbe the event that there will be a strike. We have to find P(A). We have\nP(B) =0.65, P(no strike) = P(B′) = 1 − P(B) = 1 − 0.65 = 0.35\nP(A|B) =0.32, P(A|B′) = 0.80\nSince events B and B′ form a partition of the sample space S, therefore, by theorem\non total probability, we have\nP(A) =P(B) P(A|B) + P(B′) P(A|B′)\n= 0.65 × 0.32 + 0.35 × 0.8\n= 0.208 + 0.28 = 0.488\nThus, the probability that the construction job will be completed in time is 0.488. We shall now state and prove the Bayes' theorem. Bayes’ Theorem If E , E ,..., E are n non empty events which constitute a partition\n1 2 n\nof sample space S, i.e. E , E ,..., E are pairwise disjoint and E ∪ E ∪ ... ∪ E = S and\n1 2 n 1 2 n\nA is any event of nonzero probability, then\nP(E )P(A|E )\nP(E|A) = i i for any i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n\ni n\n∑\nP(E )P(A|E )\nj j\nj=1\nProof By formula of conditional probability, we know that\nP(A∩E )\nP(E|A) = i\ni P(A)\nP(E )P(A|E )\n= i i (by multiplication rule of probability)\nP(A)\nP(E )P(A|E )\n= i i (by the result of theorem of total probability)\nn\n∑\nP(E )P(A|E )\nj j\nj=1\nReprint 2025-26\n426 MATHEMATICS\nRemark The following terminology is generally used when Bayes' theorem is applied. The events E , E , ..., E are called hypotheses. 1 2 n\nThe probability P(E) is called the priori probability of the hypothesis E\ni i\nThe conditional probability P(E |A) is called a posteriori probability of the\ni\nhypothesis E. i\nBayes' theorem is also called the formula for the probability of \"causes\". Since the\nE's are a partition of the sample space S, one and only one of the events E occurs (i.e. i i\none of the events E must occur and only one can occur). Hence, the above formula\ni\ngives us the probability of a particular E (i.e. a \"Cause\"), given that the event A has\ni\noccurred. The Bayes' theorem has its applications in variety of situations, few of which are\nillustrated in following examples. Example 16 Bag I contains 3 red and 4 black balls while another Bag II contains 5 red\nand 6 black balls. One ball is drawn at random from one of the bags and it is found to\nbe red. Find the probability that it was drawn from Bag II. Solution Let E be the event of choosing the bag I, E the event of choosing the bag II\n1 2\nand A be the event of drawing a red ball. 1\nThen P(E ) = P(E) =\n1 2 2\n3\nAlso P(A|E ) = P(drawing a red ball from Bag I) =\n1 7\n5\nand P(A|E ) = P(drawing a red ball from Bag II) =\n2 11\nNow, the probability of drawing a ball from Bag II, being given that it is red,\nis P(E |A)\n2\nBy using Bayes' theorem, we have\n1 5\n×\nP(E )P(A|E ) 2 11 35\nP(E |A) = 2 2 = =\n2 P(E )P(A|E )+P(E )P(A|E ) 1 3 1 5 68\n1 1 2 2 × + ×\n2 7 2 11\nExample 17 Given three identical boxes I, II and III, each containing two coins.

A treatise on gambling\nnamed liber de Ludo Alcae, by Geronimo Carden (1501-1576) was published\nposthumously in 1663. In this treatise, he gives the number of favourable cases\nfor each event when two dice are thrown. Galileo (1564-1642) gave casual remarks concerning the correct evaluation\nof chance in a game of three dice. Galileo analysed that when three dice are\nthrown, the sum of the number that appear is more likely to be 10 than the sum 9,\nbecause the number of cases favourable to 10 are more than the number of\ncases for the appearance of number 9. Apart from these early contributions, it is generally acknowledged that the\ntrue origin of the science of probability lies in the correspondence between two\ngreat men of the seventeenth century, Pascal (1623-1662) and Pierre de Fermat\n(1601-1665). A French gambler, Chevalier de Metre asked Pascal to explain\nsome seeming contradiction between his theoretical reasoning and the\nobservation gathered from gambling. In a series of letters written around 1654,\nPascal and Fermat laid the first foundation of science of probability. Pascal solved\nthe problem in algebraic manner while Fermat used the method of combinations. Great Dutch Scientist, Huygens (1629-1695), became acquainted with the\ncontent of the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat and published a first\nbook on probability, \"De Ratiociniis in Ludo Aleae\" containing solution of many\ninteresting rather than difficult problems on probability in games of chances. The next great work on probability theory is by Jacob Bernoulli (1654-1705),\nin the form of a great book, \"Ars Conjectendi\" published posthumously in 1713\nby his nephew, Nicholes Bernoulli. To him is due the discovery of one of the most\nimportant probability distribution known as Binomial distribution. The next\nremarkable work on probability lies in 1993. A. N. Kolmogorov (1903-1987) is\ncredited with the axiomatic theory of probability. His book, ‘Foundations of\nprobability’ published in 1933, introduces probability as a set function and is\nconsidered a ‘classic!’. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
