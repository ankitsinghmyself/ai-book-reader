This principle marks a departure from the\nlegacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between\nthe school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF\nsignify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning\nand the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these\nmeasures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of\neducation outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will\ntake to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities\nand questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate\nnew knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the\nprescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other\nresources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible\nif we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body\nof knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The\nmethods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of\nstress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden\nby restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration\nfor child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance\nthis endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and\nwondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the\nhard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book.", "We\nwish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics,\nProfessor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Professor K. Muralidhar,\nDepartment of Zoology, University of Delhi, Delhi for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook. We are grateful to their\nprincipals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations\nwhich have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed\nIII\nReprint 2025-26\nby the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource\nDevelopment under the Chairmanship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande,\nfor their valuable time and contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the\nquality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement.

The\nNational Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing\nopportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT\nhas undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning\nOutcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration\nin this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from\nteachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-learning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. V\nReprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\nPREFACE\nBiology is the study of life in its entirety. The growth of biology as a natural science during\nthe last 1000 years is interesting from many points of view. One feature of this growth is\nchanging emphasis. Initially it was description of life forms. Identification, nomenclature,\nclassification of all recorded living forms enjoyed the attention of scientists for a long time. Description of their habitats and (in the case of animals) their behaviour was included in\nthis study. In later years, the focus was physiology and internal morphology or anatomy. Darwinian ideas of evolution by natural selection changed the perception completely.", "Classical\ndescriptive and clueless biology found a theoretical framework in the evolutionary theory of\nDarwin. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Physics and Chemistry were applied to Biology\nand the new science of Biochemistry soon became the dominant face of biology. On one hand\nBiochemistry was integrating with Physiology, becoming almost synonymous with it. On the\nother hand it gave rise to Structural Biology (structure of biomacromolecules), originally called\nMolecular Biology. The work of Bernal, Pauling, Watson and Crick, Hodgkins, Perutz and Kendrew,\nDelbruck, Luria, Monod, Beadle and Tatum, Lederberg, Brenner, Benzer, Nirenberg, Khorana,\nMclintock, Sanger, Cohen, Boyer, Kornbergs (father and son), Leder, Chambon and scores of\nothers brought in and established a modern version of Molecular Biology dealing with life\nprocesses at molecular level. Physics and Chemistry dominated public perception of science for a long time. Daytoday life of man was influenced by developments in Physics, Chemistry and their respective\nmanufacturing industries. Slowly and steadily, Biology, not to be left behind, demonstrated\nits utility for human welfare. Medical practice, especially diagnostics, green revolution and\nthe newly emerging biotechnology and its success stories made the presence of biology felt\nby the common man. Patent laws brought biology into political domain and commercial value\nof biology became obvious. For more than a century, classical and so-called reductionist biology fought artifical\nbattles. The fact is both are important. Ecology brought in synthesis of both approaches\nand emphasised integrated understanding of biology. Form and process are both equally\nimportant. Systems biology, using mathematical tools, is bringing about a modern synthesis\nof both the aspects of Biology. The Class XI and XII textbooks in biology essentially were to reflect these threads of\nbiological thought. While the Class XI book dealt with morphology, taxonomy, molecular and\ncellular aspects of physiology, the Class XII book deals with the physiological process of\nreproduction in flowering plants and humans, the principles of inheritance, the nature of\ngenetic material and its function, the contributions of biology to human welfare, basic\nprinciples of biotechnological processes and their applications and achievements. The\nClass XII book also relates genes to evolution on one hand and presents ecological interactions,\nbehaviour of populations and ecosystems on the other. Most important, the guidelines under\nNCF-2005 have been followed in letter and spirit. The total learning load has been reduced\nVII\nReprint 2025-26\nconsiderably and themes like environmental issues, adolescent problems and reproductive\nhealth have been dealt with in some detail. Studied together, the class XI and class XII\ntextbooks in Biology would enable the student to —\n(i) become familiar with the diversity of biological material.", "(ii) appreciate and believe in the Darwinian evolutionary process exhibited by the living\nworld. (iii) understand the dynamic state of constituents of living bodies, i.e., metabolic\nbasis of all physiological processes in plants, animals and microbes. (iv) realise the structure and function of genetic material in directing the inherited\nphenotype pattern as well as a mediator of evolutionary process. (v) appreciate the profound contributions of biology to human welfare. (vi) reflect on the physico-chemical basis of living processes and at the same time\nrealise the limitation of reductionism in understanding behaviour of organisms. (vii) experience the humbling effect of this realisation that all living organisms are\nrelated to each other by virtue of shared genetic material. (viii) realise that biology is the story of the struggle of living organisms for existence\nand survival. One may notice a perceptible change in the writing style. Most of the chapters are written\nin an easy dialogue style engaging the student constantly while some chapters are in the\nform of critical comments on the subject matter. A number of questions have been provided\nat the end of each chapter though answers to some may not be found in the text. Students\nhave to read supplementary material, upon advise from the teacher, to answer such questions. I am thankful to Professor Krishna Kumar, Director NCERT; Professor G. Ravindra, Joint\nDirector, NCERT and Professor Hukum Singh, Head, DESM, NCERT for constant support. I\nmust place on record my deep appreciation for Dr B.K. Tripathi, Reader, DESM, NCERT for\nhis relentless efforts as coordinator in bringing out the Biology textbook for both the\nClass XI and XII. All the members of the development team, the experts and reviewers, and\nthe school teachers have contributed enormously in the preparation of this book. I thank\nthem all. I am indeed highly thankful to the members of monitoring committee constituted\nby Ministry of Human Resource Development for their valuable observation that helped in\nthe improvement of the book at the final stage. The book is prepared keeping in mind the\nguidelines of the NCF-2005 especially the emphasis on reducing the learning load. We hope that\nthe book would meet the expectations of all the stakeholders. All suggestions for further\nimprovement are always welcome. K.
