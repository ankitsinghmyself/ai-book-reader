["10 MATHEMATICS\n2\nP\nOLYNOMIALS\n2.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you have studied polynomials in one variable and their degrees. Recall\nthat if p(x) is a polynomial in x, the highest power of x in p(x) is called the degree of\nthe polynomial p(x). For example, 4x + 2 is a polynomial in the variable x of\ndegree 1, 2y2 – 3y + 4 is a polynomial in the variable y of degree 2, 5x3 – 4x2 + x – 2\n3\nis a polynomial in the variable x of degree 3 and 7u6 – u4 4u2  u 8 is a polynomial\n2\n1 1\nin the variable u of degree 6. Expressions like , x  2, etc., are\nx 1 x2  2x  3\nnot polynomials. A polynomial of degree 1 is called a linear polynomial. For example, 2x – 3,\n2 2\n3x  5, y 2 , x  , 3z + 4, u 1, etc., are all linear polynomials. Polynomials\n11 3\nsuch as 2x + 5 – x2, x3 + 1, etc., are not linear polynomials. A polynomial of degree 2 is called a quadratic polynomial. The name ‘quadratic’\n2\nhas been derived from the word ‘quadrate’, which means ‘square’. 2x2 3x  ,\n5\nu 2 1\ny2 – 2, 2 x2 3x,  2u2 5, 5v2  v,4z2  are some examples of\n3 3 7\nquadratic polynomials (whose coefficients are real numbers). More generally, any\nquadratic polynomial in x is of the form ax2 + bx + c, where a, b, c are real numbers\nand a  0. A polynomial of degree 3 is called a cubic polynomial. Some examples of\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS 11\na cubic polynomial are 2 – x3, x3, 2x3, 3 – x2 + x3, 3x3 – 2x2 + x – 1. In fact, the most\ngeneral form of a cubic polynomial is\nax3 + bx2 + cx + d,\nwhere, a, b, c, d are real numbers and a  0. Now consider the polynomial p(x) = x2 – 3x – 4. Then, putting x = 2 in the\npolynomial, we get p(2) = 22 – 3 × 2 – 4 = – 6. The value ‘– 6’, obtained by replacing\nx by 2 in x2 – 3x – 4, is the value of x2 – 3x – 4 at x = 2. Similarly, p(0) is the value of\np(x) at x = 0, which is – 4. If p(x) is a polynomial in x, and if k is any real number, then the value obtained by\nreplacing x by k in p(x), is called the value of p(x) at x = k, and is denoted by p(k). What is the value of p(x) = x2 –3x – 4 at x = –1? We have :\np(–1) = (–1)2 –{3 × (–1)} – 4 = 0\nAlso, note that p(4) =42 – (3  4) – 4 = 0. As p(–1) = 0 and p(4) = 0, –1 and 4 are called the zeroes of the quadratic\npolynomial x2 – 3x – 4. More generally, a real number k is said to be a zero of a\npolynomial p(x), if p(k) = 0. You have already studied in Class IX, how to find the zeroes of a linear\npolynomial. For example, if k is a zero of p(x) = 2x + 3, then p(k) = 0 gives us\n3\n2k + 3 = 0, i.e., k =  \n2\nb\nIn general, if k is a zero of p(x) = ax + b, then p(k) = ak + b = 0, i.e., k  \na\nb (Constant term)\nSo, the zero of the linear polynomial ax + b is  . a Coefficient of x\nThus, the zero of a linear polynomial is related to its coefficients. Does this\nhappen in the case of other polynomials too? For example, are the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial also related to its coefficients? In this chapter, we will try to answer these questions. We will also study the\ndivision algorithm for polynomials.", "2.2 Geometrical Meaning of the Zeroes of a Polynomial\nYou know that a real number k is a zero of the polynomial p(x) if p(k) = 0. But why\nare the zeroes of a polynomial so important? To answer this, first we will see the\ngeometrical representations of linear and quadratic polynomials and the geometrical\nmeaning of their zeroes. Reprint 2025-26\n12 MATHEMATICS\nConsider first a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0. You have studied in Class IX that the\ngraph of y = ax + b is a straight line. For example, the graph of y = 2x + 3 is a straight\nline passing through the points (– 2, –1) and (2, 7). x –2 2\ny = 2x + 3 –1 7\nFrom Fig. 2.1, you can see\nthat the graph of y = 2x + 3\nintersects the x-axis mid-way\nbetween x = –1 and x = –2,\n 3 \nthat is, at the point  ,0 .  2 \nYou also know that the zero of\n3\n2x + 3 is  . Thus, the zero of\n2\nthe polynomial 2x + 3 is the\nx-coordinate of the point where the\nFig. 2.1\ngraph of y = 2x + 3 intersects the\nx-axis. In general, for a linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, the graph of y = ax + b is a\nb \nstraight line which intersects the x-axis at exactly one point, namely, ,0. \n a \nTherefore, the linear polynomial ax + b, a  0, has exactly one zero, namely, the\nx-coordinate of the point where the graph of y = ax + b intersects the x-axis. Now, let us look for the geometrical meaning of a zero of a quadratic polynomial. Consider the quadratic polynomial x2 – 3x – 4. Let us see what the graph* of\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 looks like. Let us list a few values of y = x2 – 3x – 4 corresponding to\na few values for x as given in Table 2.1. * Plotting of graphs of quadratic or cubic polynomials is not meant to be done by the students,\nnor is to be evaluated. Reprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS 13\nTable 2.1\nx – 2 –1 0 1 2 3 4 5\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 6 0 – 4 – 6 – 6 – 4 0 6\nIf we locate the points listed\nabove on a graph paper and draw\nthe graph, it will actually look like\nthe one given in Fig. 2.2. In fact, for any quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, the\ngraph of the corresponding\nequation y = ax2 + bx + c has one\nof the two shapes either open\nupwards like or open\ndownwards like depending on\nwhether a > 0 or a < 0. (These\ncurves are called parabolas.)\nYou can see from Table 2.1\nthat –1 and 4 are zeroes of the\nquadratic polynomial. Also\nnote from Fig. 2.2 that –1 and 4\nare the x-coordinates of the points\nwhere the graph of y = x2 – 3x – 4\nintersects the x-axis. Thus, the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nx2 – 3x – 4 are x-coordinates of\nthe points where the graph of\nFig. 2.2\ny = x2 – 3x – 4 intersects the\nx-axis. This fact is true for any quadratic polynomial, i.e., the zeroes of a quadratic\npolynomial ax2 + bx + c, a  0, are precisely the x-coordinates of the points where the\nparabola representing y = ax2 + bx + c intersects the x-axis.", "From our observation earlier about the shape of the graph of y = ax2 + bx + c, the\nfollowing three cases can happen:\nReprint 2025-26\n14 MATHEMATICS\nCase (i) : Here, the graph cuts x-axis at two distinct points A and A. The x-coordinates of A and A are the two zeroes of the quadratic polynomial\nax2 + bx + c in this case (see Fig. 2.3). Fig. 2.3\nCase (ii) : Here, the graph cuts the x-axis at exactly one point, i.e., at two coincident\npoints. So, the two points A and A of Case (i) coincide here to become one point A\n(see Fig. 2.4). Fig. 2.4\nThe x-coordinate of A is the only zero for the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c\nin this case. Reprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS 15\nCase (iii) : Here, the graph is either completely above the x-axis or completely below\nthe x-axis. So, it does not cut the x-axis at any point (see Fig. 2.5). Fig. 2.5\nSo, the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c has no zero in this case. So, you can see geometrically that a quadratic polynomial can have either two\ndistinct zeroes or two equal zeroes (i.e., one zero), or no zero. This also means that a\npolynomial of degree 2 has atmost two zeroes. Now, what do you expect the geometrical meaning of the zeroes of a cubic\npolynomial to be? Let us find out. Consider the cubic polynomial x3 – 4x. To see what\nthe graph of y = x3 – 4x looks like, let us list a few values of y corresponding to a few\nvalues for x as shown in Table 2.2. Table 2.2\nx –2 –1 0 1 2\ny = x3 – 4x 0 3 0 –3 0\nLocating the points of the table on a graph paper and drawing the graph, we see\nthat the graph of y = x3 – 4x actually looks like the one given in Fig. 2.6. Reprint 2025-26\n16 MATHEMATICS\nWe see from the table above\nthat – 2, 0 and 2 are zeroes of the\ncubic polynomial x3 – 4x. Observe\nthat –2, 0 and 2 are, in fact, the\nx-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – 4x\nintersects the x-axis. Since the curve\nmeets the x-axis in only these 3\npoints, their x-coordinates are the\nonly zeroes of the polynomial. Let us take a few more\nexamples. Consider the cubic\npolynomials x3 and x3 – x2. We draw\nthe graphs of y = x3 and y = x3 – x2\nin Fig. 2.7 and Fig. 2.8 respectively. Fig. 2.6\nFig. 2.7 Fig. 2.8\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS 17\nNote that 0 is the only zero of the polynomial x3. Also, from Fig. 2.7, you can see\nthat 0 is the x-coordinate of the only point where the graph of y = x3 intersects the\nx-axis. Similarly, since x3 – x2 = x2 (x – 1), 0 and 1 are the only zeroes of the polynomial\nx3 – x2. Also, from Fig. 2.8, these values are the x-coordinates of the only points\nwhere the graph of y = x3 – x2 intersects the x-axis. From the examples above, we see that there are at most 3 zeroes for any cubic\npolynomial. In other words, any polynomial of degree 3 can have at most three zeroes. Remark : In general, given a polynomial p(x) of degree n, the graph of y = p(x)\nintersects the x-axis at atmost n points. Therefore, a polynomial p(x) of degree n has\nat most n zeroes. Example 1 : Look at the graphs in Fig.", "2.9 given below. Each is the graph of y = p(x),\nwhere p(x) is a polynomial. For each of the graphs, find the number of zeroes of p(x). Fig. 2.9\nSolution :\n(i) The number of zeroes is 1 as the graph intersects the x-axis at one point only. (ii) The number of zeroes is 2 as the graph intersects the x-axis at two points. (iii) The number of zeroes is 3. (Why?)\nReprint 2025-26\n18 MATHEMATICS\n(iv) The number of zeroes is 1. (Why?)\n(v) The number of zeroes is 1. (Why?)\n(vi) The number of zeroes is 4. (Why?)\nEXERCISE 2.1\n1. The graphs of y = p(x) are given in Fig. 2.10 below, for some polynomials p(x). Find the\nnumber of zeroes of p(x), in each case. Fig. 2.10\n2.3 Relationship between Zeroes and Coefficients of a Polynomial\nb\nYou have already seen that zero of a linear polynomial ax + b is  . We will now try\na\nto answer the question raised in Section 2.1 regarding the relationship between zeroes\nand coefficients of a quadratic polynomial. For this, let us take a quadratic polynomial,\nsay p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6. In Class IX, you have learnt how to factorise quadratic\npolynomials by splitting the middle term. So, here we need to split the middle term\n‘– 8x’ as a sum of two terms, whose product is 6 × 2x2 = 12x2. So, we write\n2x2 – 8x + 6 = 2x2 – 6x – 2x + 6 = 2x(x – 3) – 2(x – 3)\n= (2x – 2)(x – 3) = 2(x – 1)(x – 3)\nReprint 2025-26\nPOLYNOMIALS 19\nSo, the value of p(x) = 2x2 – 8x + 6 is zero when x – 1 = 0 or x – 3 = 0, i.e., when\nx = 1 or x = 3. So, the zeroes of 2x2 – 8x + 6 are 1 and 3. Observe that :\n(8) (Coefficient of x)\nSum of its zeroes = 134 \n2 Coefficient of x2\n6 Constant term\nProduct of its zeroes = 133 \n2 Coefficient of x2\nLet us take one more quadratic polynomial, say, p(x) = 3x2 + 5x – 2. By the\nmethod of splitting the middle term,\n3x2 + 5x – 2 = 3x2 + 6x – x – 2 = 3x(x + 2) –1(x + 2)\n= (3x – 1)(x + 2)\nHence, the value of 3x2 + 5x – 2 is zero when either 3x – 1 = 0 or x + 2 = 0, i.e.,\n1 1\nwhen x = or x = –2. So, the zeroes of 3x2 + 5x – 2 are and – 2.

Therefore,\nax2 + bx + c = k(x – ) (x – ), where k is a constant\n= k[x2 – ( + )x + ]\n= kx2 – k( + )x + k \nComparing the coefficients of x2, x and constant terms on both the sides, we get\na = k, b = – k( + ) and c = k\n–b\nThis gives  +  = ,\na\nc\n =\na\n* , are Greek letters pronounced as ‘alpha’ and ‘beta’ respectively.

Solution : We have\nx2 + 7x + 10 = (x + 2)(x + 5)\nSo, the value of x2 + 7x + 10 is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x + 5 = 0, i.e., when x = – 2 or\nx = –5. Therefore, the zeroes of x2 + 7x + 10 are – 2 and – 5.

So, one quadratic polynomial which fits the given conditions is x2 + 3x + 2. You can check that any other quadratic polynomial that fits these conditions will\nbe of the form k(x2 + 3x + 2), where k is real. Let us now look at cubic polynomials. Do you think a similar relation holds\nbetween the zeroes of a cubic polynomial and its coefficients? Let us consider p(x) = 2x3 – 5x2 – 14x + 8. 1\nYou can check that p(x) = 0 for x = 4, – 2,  Since p(x) can have atmost three\n2\nzeroes, these are the zeores of 2x3 – 5x2 – 14x + 8.
