["6\nCHAPTER\nControl and\nCoordination\nIn the previous chapter, we looked at life processes involved in the\nmaintenance functions in living organisms. There, we had started with\na notion we all have, that if we see something moving, it is alive. Some of\nthese movements are in fact the result of growth, as in plants. A seed\ngerminates and grows, and we can see that the seedling moves over the\ncourse of a few days, it pushes soil aside and comes out. But if its growth\nwere to be stopped, these movements would not happen. Some\nmovements, as in many animals and some plants, are not connected\nwith growth. A cat running, children playing on swings, buffaloes\nchewing cud – these are not movements caused by growth. Why do we associate such visible movements with life? A possible\nanswer is that we think of movement as a response to a change in the\nenvironment of the organism. The cat may be running because it has\nseen a mouse. Not only that, we also think of movement as an attempt\nby living organisms to use changes in their environment to their\nadvantage. Plants grow out into the sunshine. Children try to get pleasure\nand fun out of swinging. Buffaloes chew cud to help break up tough\nfood so as to be able to digest it better. When bright light is focussed on\nour eyes or when we touch a hot object, we detect the change and respond\nto it with movement in order to protect ourselves. If we think a bit more about this, it becomes apparent that all this\nmovement, in response to the environment, is carefully controlled. Each\nkind of a change in the environment evokes an appropriate movement\nin response. When we want to talk to our friends in class, we whisper,\nrather than shouting loudly. Clearly, the movement to be made depends\non the event that is triggering it. Therefore, such controlled movement\nmust be connected to the recognition of various events in the\nenvironment, followed by only the correct movement in response. In other\nwords, living organisms must use systems providing control and\ncoordination. In keeping with the general principles of body organisation\nin multicellular organisms, specialised tissues are used to provide these\ncontrol and coordination activities. 66666.....11111 AAAAANNNNNIIIIIMMMMMAAAAALLLLLSSSSS ––––– NNNNNEEEEERRRRRVVVVVOOOOOUUUUUSSSSS SSSSSYYYYYSSSSSTTTTTEEEEEMMMMM\nIn animals, such control and coordination are provided by nervous and\nmuscular tissues, which we have studied in Class IX. Touching a hot\n100 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nobject is an urgent and dangerous\nsituation for us. We need to detect it,\nand respond to it. How do we detect that\nwe are touching a hot object? All\ninformation from our environment is\ndetected by the specialised tips of some\nnerve cells. These receptors are usually\nlocated in our sense organs, such as the\ninner ear, the nose, the tongue, and so\n(a)\non. So gustatory receptors will detect taste\nwhile olfactory receptors will detect smell.", "This information, acquired at the\nend of the dendritic tip of a nerve cell\n[Fig. 6.1 (a)], sets off a chemical reaction\nthat creates an electrical impulse. This\nimpulse travels from the dendrite to the\ncell body, and then along the axon to its\nend. At the end of the axon, the electrical\nimpulse sets off the release of some\nchemicals. These chemicals cross the\ngap, or synapse, and start a similar (b)\nelectrical impulse in a dendrite of the next\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....11111 (a) Structure of neuron, (b) Neuromuscular\nneuron. This is a general scheme of how\njunction\nnervous impulses travel in the body. A\nsimilar synapse finally allows delivery of such impulses from neurons to\nother cells, such as muscles cells or gland [Fig. 6.1 (b)]. It is thus no surprise that nervous tissue is made up of an organised\nnetwork of nerve cells or neurons, and is specialised for conducting\ninformation via electrical impulses from one part of the body to another. Look at Fig. 6.1 (a) and identify the parts of a neuron (i) where\ninformation is acquired, (ii) through which information travels as an\nelectrical impulse, and (iii) where this impulse must be converted into a\nchemical signal for onward transmission.

Is there a difference in how sugar and food taste if your nose is\nblocked? If so, why might this be happening? Read and talk about\npossible explanations for these kinds of differences. Do you come across\na similar situation when you have a cold? Control and Coordination 101\nReprint 2025-26\n6.1.1 What happens in Reflex Actions? ‘Reflex’ is a word we use very commonly when we talk about some sudden\naction in response to something in the environment. We say ‘I jumped\nout of the way of the bus reflexly’, or ‘I pulled my hand back from the\nflame reflexly’, or ‘I was so hungry my mouth started watering reflexly’. What exactly do we mean? A common idea in all such examples is that\nwe do something without thinking about it, or without feeling in control\nof our reactions. Yet these are situations where we are responding with\nsome action to changes in our environment. How is control and\ncoordination achieved in such situations? Let us consider this further. Take one of our examples. Touching a\nflame is an urgent and dangerous situation for us, or in fact, for any\nanimal! How would we respond to this? One seemingly simple way is to\nthink consciously about the pain and the possibility of getting burnt,\nand therefore move our hand. An important question then is, how long\nwill it take us to think all this? The answer depends on how we think.", "If\nnerve impulses are sent around the way we have talked about earlier,\nthen thinking is also likely to involve the creation of such impulses. Thinking is a complex activity, so it is bound to involve a complicated\ninteraction of many nerve impulses from many neurons. If this is the case, it is no surprise that the thinking tissue in our\nbody consists of dense networks of intricately arranged neurons. It sits\nin the forward end of the skull, and receives signals from all over the\nbody which it thinks about before responding to them. Obviously, in\norder to receive these signals, this thinking part of the brain in the skull\nmust be connected to nerves coming from various parts of the body. Similarly, if this part of the brain is to instruct muscles to move, nerves\nmust carry this signal back to different parts of the body. If all of this is\nto be done when we touch a hot object, it may take enough time for us to\nget burnt! How does the design of the body solve this problem? Rather than\nhaving to think about the sensation of heat, if the nerves that detect heat\nwere to be connected to the nerves that move muscles in a simpler way,\nthe process of detecting the signal or the input and responding to it by\nan output action might be completed quickly. Such a connection is\ncommonly called a reflex arc (Fig. 6.2). Where should such reflex arc\nconnections be made between the input nerve and the output nerve? The best place, of course, would be at the point where they first meet\neach other. Nerves from all over the body meet in a bundle in the spinal\ncord on their way to the brain. Reflex arcs are formed in this spinal cord\nitself, although the information input also goes on to reach the brain. Of course, reflex arcs have evolved in animals because the thinking\nprocess of the brain is not fast enough. In fact many animals have very\nlittle or none of the complex neuron network needed for thinking. So it is\nquite likely that reflex arcs have evolved as efficient ways of functioning\nin the absence of true thought processes. However, even after complex\nneuron networks have come into existence, reflex arcs continue to be\nmore efficient for quick responses. 102 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....22222 Reflex arc\nCan you now trace the sequence of events which occur when a bright\nlight is focussed on your eyes? 6.1.2 Human Brain\nIs reflex action the only function of the spinal cord? Obviously not, since\nwe know that we are thinking beings. Spinal cord is made up of nerves\nwhich supply information to think about. Thinking involves more\ncomplex mechanisms and neural connections. These are concentrated\nin the brain, which is the main coordinating centre of the body. The\nbrain and spinal cord constitute the central nervous system (Fig. 6.3). They receive information from all parts of the body and integrate it. We also think about our actions.", "Writing, talking, moving a chair,\nclapping at the end of a programme are examples of voluntary actions\nwhich are based on deciding what to do next. So, the brain also has to\nsend messages to muscles. This is the second way in which the nervous\nsystem communicates with the muscles. The communication between\nthe central nervous system and the other parts of the body is facilitated\nby the peripheral nervous system consisting of cranial nerves arising\nfrom the brain and spinal nerves arising from the spinal cord. The brain\nthus allows us to think and take actions based on that thinking. As you\nwill expect, this is accomplished through a complex design, with different\nparts of the brain responsible for integrating different inputs and outputs. The brain has three such major parts or regions, namely the fore-brain,\nmid-brain and hind-brain. The fore-brain is the main thinking part of the brain. It has regions\nwhich receive sensory impulses from various receptors. Separate areas\nof the fore-brain are specialised for hearing, smell, sight and so on. There\nare separate areas of association where this sensory information is\ninterpreted by putting it together with information from other receptors\nas well as with information that is already stored in the brain. Based on\nControl and Coordination 103\nReprint 2025-26\nall this, a decision is made about how to respond and the information is\npassed on to the motor areas which control the movement of voluntary\nmuscles, for example, our leg muscles. However, certain sensations are\ndistinct from seeing or hearing, for example, how do we know that we\nhave eaten enough? The sensation of feeling full is because of a centre\nassociated with hunger, which is in a separate part of the fore-brain. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....33333 Human brain\nStudy the labelled diagram of the human brain. We have seen that\nthe different parts have specific functions. Can we find out the function\nof each part? Let us look at the other use of the word ‘reflex’ that we have talked\nabout in the introduction. Our mouth waters when we see food we like\nwithout our meaning to. Our hearts beat without our thinking about it. In fact, we cannot control these actions easily by thinking about them\neven if we wanted to. Do we have to think about or remember to breathe\nor digest food? So, in between the simple reflex actions like change in\nthe size of the pupil, and the thought out actions such as moving a\nchair, there is another set of muscle movements over which we do not\nhave any thinking control. Many of these involuntary actions are\ncontrolled by the mid-brain and hind-brain. All these involuntary actions\nincluding blood pressure, salivation and vomiting are controlled by the\nmedulla in the hind-brain. Think about activities like walking in a straight line, riding a bicycle,\npicking up a pencil. These are possible due to a part of the hind-brain\ncalled the cerebellum.", "It is responsible for precision of voluntary actions\nand maintaining the posture and balance of the body. Imagine what\nwould happen if each of these events failed to take place if we were not\nthinking about it. 104 Science\nReprint 2025-26\n6.1.3 How are these Tissues protected? A delicate organ like the brain, which is so important for a variety of\nactivities, needs to be carefully protected. For this, the body is designed\nso that the brain sits inside a bony box. Inside the box, the brain is\ncontained in a fluid-filled balloon which provides further shock\nabsorption. If you run your hand down the middle of your back, you\nwill feel a hard, bumpy structure. This is the vertebral column or\nbackbone which protects the spinal cord. 6.1.4 How does the Nervous Tissue cause Action? So far, we have been talking about nervous tissue, and how it collects\ninformation, sends it around the body, processes information, makes\ndecisions based on information, and conveys decisions to muscles for\naction. In other words, when the action or movement is to be performed,\nmuscle tissue will do the final job. How do animal muscles move? When\na nerve impulse reaches the muscle, the muscle fibre must move. How\ndoes a muscle cell move? The simplest notion of movement at the cellular\nlevel is that muscle cells will move by changing their shape so that they\nshorten. So the next question is, how do muscle cells change their shape? The answer must lie in the chemistry of cellular components. Muscle\ncells have special proteins that change both their shape and their\narrangement in the cell in response to nervous electrical impulses. When\nthis happens, new arrangements of these proteins give the muscle cells\na shorter form. Remember when we talked about muscle tissue in\nClass IX, there were different kinds of muscles, such as voluntary muscles\nand involuntary muscles. Based on what we have discussed so far, what\ndo you think the differences between these would be? Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. What is the difference between a reflex action and walking? 2. What happens at the synapse between two neurons? 3. Which part of the brain maintains posture and equilibrium of the body? 4. How do we detect the smell of an agarbatti (incense stick)? 5.

But plants have neither a nervous system nor\nmuscles. So, how do they respond to stimuli? When we touch the leaves\nof a chhui-mui (the ‘sensitive’ or ‘touch-me-not’ plant of the Mimosa\nfamily), they begin to fold up and droop. When a seed germinates, the\nroot goes down, the stem comes up into the air. What happens? Firstly,\nthe leaves of the sensitive plant move very quickly in response to touch. Control and Coordination 105\nReprint 2025-26\nThere is no growth involved in this movement.", "On the other hand, the\ndirectional movement of a seedling is caused by growth. If it is prevented\nfrom growing, it will not show any movement. So plants show two different\ntypes of movement – one dependent on growth and the other independent\nof growth. 6.2.1 Immediate Response to Stimulus\nLet us think about the first kind of movement, such as that of the sensitive\nplant. Since no growth is involved, the plant must actually move its leaves\nin response to touch. But there is no nervous tissue, nor any muscle\ntissue. How does the plant detect the touch, and how do the leaves move\nin response? FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....44444 The sensitive plant\nIf we think about where exactly the plant is touched, and what part\nof the plant actually moves, it is apparent that movement happens at a\npoint different from the point of touch. So, information that a touch has\noccurred must be communicated. The plants also use electrical-chemical\nmeans to convey this information from cell to cell, but unlike in animals,\nthere is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information. Finally, again as in animals, some cells must change shape in order for\nmovement to happen. Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal\nmuscle cells, plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water\nin them, resulting in swelling or shrinking, and therefore in changing\nshapes (Fig. 6.4). 6.2.2 Movement Due to Growth\nSome plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means\nof tendrils. These tendrils are sensitive to touch. When they come in\ncontact with any support, the part of the tendril in contact with the object\ndoes not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object. This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it. More commonly, plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a\nparticular direction. Because this growth is directional, it appears as if\nthe plant is moving. Let us understand this type of movement with the\nhelp of an example. 106 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 66666.....22222\nn Fill a conical flask with water. n Cover the neck of the flask with a wire mesh. n Keep two or three freshly germinated bean\nseeds on the wire mesh. n Take a cardboard box which is open from one\nside. n Keep the flask in the box in such a manner\nthat the open side of the box faces light coming\nfrom a window (Fig. 6.5). n After two or three days, you will notice that\nthe shoots bend towards light and roots away\nfrom light. n Now turn the flask so that the shoots are away\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....55555\nfrom light and the roots towards light. Leave it\nResponse of the plant to the direction of light\nundisturbed in this condition for a few days. n Have the old parts of the shoot and root\nchanged direction? n Are there differences in the direction of the new\ngrowth? n What can we conclude from this activity?", "Environmental triggers such as light, or gravity\nwill change the directions that plant parts grow in. These directional, or tropic, movements can be either\ntowards the stimulus, or away from it. So, in two\ndifferent kinds of phototropic movement, shoots\nrespond by bending towards light while roots\nrespond by bending away from it. How does this help FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 66666.....66666 Plant showing geotropism\nthe plant? Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well. The roots\nof a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow\nupwards and away from the earth. This upward and downward growth\nof shoots and roots, respectively, in response to the pull of earth or gravity\nis, obviously, geotropism (Fig. 6.6). If ‘hydro’ means water and ‘chemo’\nrefers to chemicals, what would ‘hydrotropism’ and ‘chemotropism’\nmean? Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth\nmovements? One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes\ntowards ovules, about which we will learn more when we examine the\nreproductive processes of living organisms. Let us now once again think about how information is communicated\nin the bodies of multicellular organisms. The movement of the\nsensitive plant in response to touch is very quick. The movement of\nsunflowers in response to day or night, on the other hand, is quite slow. Growth-related movement of plants will be even slower. Even in animal bodies, there are carefully controlled directions to\ngrowth. Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions, not haphazardly. So controlled movements can be either slow or fast. If fast responses to\nstimuli are to be made, information transfer must happen very quickly. For this, the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly. Control and Coordination 107\nReprint 2025-26\nElectrical impulses are an excellent means for this. But there are\nlimitations to the use of electrical impulses. Firstly, they will reach only\nthose cells that are connected by nervous tissue, not each and every cell\nin the animal body. Secondly, once an electrical impulse is generated in\na cell and transmitted, the cell will take some time to reset its mechanisms\nbefore it can generate and transmit a new impulse. In other words, cells\ncannot continually create and transmit electrical impulses. It is thus no\nwonder that most multicellular organisms use another means of\ncommunication between cells, namely, chemical communication. If, instead of generating an electrical impulse, stimulated cells release\na chemical compound, this compound would diffuse all around the\noriginal cell. If other cells around have the means to detect this compound\nusing special molecules on their surfaces, then they would be able to\nrecognise information, and even transmit it. This will be slower, of course,\nbut it can potentially reach all cells of the body, regardless of nervous\nconnections, and it can be done steadily and persistently.", "These\ncompounds, or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control\nand coordination show a great deal of diversity, as we would expect. Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth, development and\nresponses to the environment. They are synthesised at places away from\nwhere they act and simply diffuse to the area of action. Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier [Activity 6.2]. When growing plants detect light, a hormone called auxin, synthesised\nat the shoot tip, helps the cells to grow longer. When light is coming from\none side of the plant, auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot. This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the\nside of the shoot which is away from light. Thus, the plant appears to\nbend towards light. Another example of plant hormones are gibberellins which, like\nauxins, help in the growth of the stem. Cytokinins promote cell division,\nand it is natural then that they are present in greater concentration in\nareas of rapid cell division, such as in fruits and seeds. These are examples\nof plant hormones that help in promoting growth. But plants also need\nsignals to stop growing. Abscisic acid is one example of a hormone which\ninhibits growth. Its effects include wilting of leaves. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. What are plant hormones? 2. How is the movement of leaves of the sensitive plant different from the\nmovement of a shoot towards light? 3. Give an example of a plant hormone that promotes growth. 4. How do auxins promote the growth of a tendril around a support? 5. Design an experiment to demonstrate hydrotropism. 108 Science\nReprint 2025-26\n66666.....33333 HHHHHOOOOORRRRRMMMMMOOOOONNNNNEEEEESSSSS IIIIINNNNN AAAAANNNNNIIIIIMMMMMAAAAALLLLLSSSSS\nHow are such chemical, or hormonal, means of information transmission\nused in animals? What do some animals, for instance squirrels,\nexperience when they are in a scary situation? Their bodies have to\nprepare for either fighting or running away. Both are very complicated\nactivities that will use a great deal of energy in controlled ways. Many\ndifferent tissue types will be used and their activities integrated together\nin these actions. However, the two alternate activities, fighting or running,\nare also quite different! So here is a situation in which some common\npreparations can be usefully made in the body. These preparations\nshould ideally make it easier to do either activity in the near future. How\nwould this be achieved? If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses\nvia nerve cells, the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming\nactivity would be limited. On the other hand, if a chemical signal were to\nbe sent as well, it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide-\nranging changes needed. This is done in many animals, including human\nbeings, using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the\nadrenal glands. Look at Fig. 6.7 to locate these glands.", "Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different\nparts of the body. The target organs or the specific tissues on which it\nacts include the heart. As a result, the heart beats faster, resulting in\nsupply of more oxygen to our muscles. The blood to the digestive system\nand skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries\nin these organs. This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles. The\nbreathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the\ndiaphragm and the rib muscles. All these responses together enable the\nanimal body to be ready to deal with the situation. Such animal hormones\nare part of the endocrine system which constitutes a second way of control\nand coordination in our body.

Consult books in the library and discuss with your\nteachers to find out about other glands. Remember that plants have hormones that control their directional\ngrowth. What functions do animal hormones perform? On the face of it,\nwe cannot imagine their role in directional growth. We have never seen\nan animal growing more in one direction or the other, depending on\nlight or gravity! But if we think about it a bit more, it will become evident\nthat, even in animal bodies, growth happens in carefully controlled places. Plants will grow leaves in many places on the plant body, for example. But we do not grow fingers on our faces. The design of the body is carefully\nmaintained even during the growth of children.
