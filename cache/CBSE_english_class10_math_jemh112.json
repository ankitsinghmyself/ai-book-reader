["SURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 161\nS A 12\nURFACE REAS AND\nV\nOLUMES\n12.1 Introduction\nFrom Class IX, you are familiar with some of the solids like cuboid, cone, cylinder, and\nsphere (see Fig. 12.1). You have also learnt how to find their surface areas and volumes. Fig. 12.1\nIn our day-to-day life, we come across a number of solids made up of combinations\nof two or more of the basic solids as shown above. You must have seen a truck with a\ncontainer fitted on its back (see Fig. 12.2),\ncarrying oil or water from one place to\nanother. Is it in the shape of any of the four\nbasic solids mentioned above? You may\nguess that it is made of a cylinder with two\nhemispheres as its ends. Fig. 12.2\nReprint 2025-26\n162 MATHEMATICS\nAgain, you may have seen an object like the\none in Fig. 12.3. Can you name it? A test tube, right! You would have used one in your science laboratory. This tube is also a combination of a cylinder and a\nhemisphere. Similarly, while travelling, you may have\nseen some big and beautiful buildings or monuments\nmade up of a combination of solids mentioned above. If for some reason you wanted to find the\nsurface areas, or volumes, or capacities of such\nobjects, how would you do it? We cannot classify\nFig. 12.3\nthese under any of the solids you have already studied. In this chapter, you will see how to find surface areas and volumes of such\nobjects. 12.2 Surface Area of a Combination of Solids\nLet us consider the container seen in Fig. 12.2. How do we find the surface area of\nsuch a solid? Now, whenever we come across a new problem, we first try to see, if\nwe can break it down into smaller problems, we have earlier solved. We can see that\nthis solid is made up of a cylinder with two hemispheres stuck at either end. It would\nlook like what we have in Fig. 12.4, after we put the pieces all together. Fig. 12.4\nIf we consider the surface of the newly formed object, we would be able to see\nonly the curved surfaces of the two hemispheres and the curved surface of the cylinder. So, the total surface area of the new solid is the sum of the curved surface\nareas of each of the individual parts. This gives,\nTSA of new solid = CSA of one hemisphere + CSA of cylinder\n+ CSA of other hemisphere\nwhere TSA, CSA stand for ‘Total Surface Area’ and ‘Curved Surface Area’\nrespectively. Let us now consider another situation. Suppose we are making a toy by putting\ntogether a hemisphere and a cone. Let us see the steps that we would be going\nthrough. Reprint 2025-26\nSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 163\nFirst, we would take a cone and a hemisphere and bring their flat faces together. Here, of course, we would take the base radius of the cone equal to the radius of the\nhemisphere, for the toy is to have a smooth surface. So, the steps would be as shown\nin Fig. 12.5. Fig. 12.5\nAt the end of our trial, we have got ourselves a nice round-bottomed toy. Now if\nwe want to find how much paint we would require to colour the surface of this toy,\nwhat would we need to know?", "We would need to know the surface area of the toy,\nwhich consists of the CSA of the hemisphere and the CSA of the cone. So, we can say:\nTotal surface area of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\nNow, let us consider some examples. Example 1 : Rasheed got a playing top (lattu) as his\nbirthday present, which surprisingly had no colour on\nit. He wanted to colour it with his crayons. The top is\nshaped like a cone surmounted by a hemisphere\n(see Fig 12.6). The entire top is 5 cm in height and\nthe diameter of the top is 3.5 cm. Find the area he\n22\nFig. 12.6\nhas to colour. (Take  = )\n7\nSolution : This top is exactly like the object we have discussed in Fig. 12.5. So, we\ncan conveniently use the result we have arrived at there. That is :\nTSA of the toy = CSA of hemisphere + CSA of cone\n1\nNow, the curved surface area of the hemisphere = (4r2)  2r2\n2\n 22 3.5 3.5\n= 2   cm2\n 7 2 2 \nReprint 2025-26\n. 164 MATHEMATICS\nAlso, the height of the cone = height of the top – height (radius) of the hemispherical part\n 3.5\n= 5 cm = 3.25 cm\n 2 \n2\n3.5\nSo, the slant height of the cone (l ) = r2  h2     (3.25)2 cm = 3.7 cm (approx.)\n 2 \n22 3.5 \nTherefore, CSA of cone = rl =   3.7cm2\n 7 2 \nThis gives the surface area of the top as\n 22 3.5 3.5 22 3.5 \n= 2   cm2   3.7cm2\n 7 2 2   7 2 \n22 3.5 11\n=  3.5 3.7cm2 = (3.53.7) cm2 39.6cm2 (approx.)\n7 2 2\nYou may note that ‘total surface area of the top’ is not the sum of the total\nsurface areas of the cone and hemisphere. Example 2 : The decorative block shown\nin Fig. 12.7 is made of two solids — a cube\nand a hemisphere. The base of the block is a\ncube with edge 5 cm, and the hemisphere\nfixed on the top has a diameter of 4.2 cm. Find the total surface area of the block. 22\n(Take  = )\n7 Fig. 12.7\nSolution : The total surface area of the cube = 6 × (edge)2 = 6 × 5 × 5 cm2 = 150 cm2. Note that the part of the cube where the hemisphere is attached is not included in the\nsurface area. So, the surface area of the block = TSA of cube – base area of hemisphere\n+ CSA of hemisphere\n= 150 – r2 + 2 r2 = (150 + r2) cm2\n22 4.2 4.2\n= 150cm2     cm2\n 7 2 2 \n= (150 + 13.86) cm2 = 163.86 cm2\nReprint 2025-26\nSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 165\nExample 3 : A wooden toy rocket is in the\nshape of a cone mounted on a cylinder, as\nshown in Fig. 12.8. The height of the entire\nrocket is 26 cm, while the height of the conical\npart is 6 cm. The base of the conical portion\nhas a diameter of 5 cm, while the base\ndiameter of the cylindrical portion is 3 cm. If\nthe conical portion is to be painted orange\nand the cylindrical portion yellow, find the\narea of the rocket painted with each of these\ncolours. (Take  = 3.14)\nSolution : Denote radius of cone by r, slant\nheight of cone by l, height of cone by h, radius\nof cylinder by r and height of cylinder by h. Then r = 2.5 cm, h = 6 cm, r = 1.5 cm,\nFig.", "12.8\nh = 26 – 6 = 20 cm and\nl = r2  h2 = 2.52  62 cm = 6.5 cm\nHere, the conical portion has its circular base resting on the base of the cylinder, but\nthe base of the cone is larger than the base of the cylinder. So, a part of the base of the\ncone (a ring) is to be painted. So, the area to be painted orange = CSA of the cone + base area of the cone\n– base area of the cylinder\n= rl + r2 – r2\n= [(2.5 × 6.5) + (2.5)2 – (1.5)2] cm2\n= [20.25] cm2 = 3.14 × 20.25 cm2\n= 63.585 cm2\nNow, the area to be painted yellow = CSA of the cylinder\n+ area of one base of the cylinder\n= 2rh + (r)2\n= r (2h + r)\n= (3.14 × 1.5) (2 × 20 + 1.5) cm2\n= 4.71 × 41.5 cm2\n= 195.465 cm2\nReprint 2025-26\n166 MATHEMATICS\nExample 4 : Mayank made a bird-bath for his garden\nin the shape of a cylinder with a hemispherical\ndepression at one end (see Fig. 12.9).

A wooden article was made by scooping\nout a hemisphere from each end of a solid\ncylinder, as shown in Fig. 12.11. If the\nheight of the cylinder is 10 cm, and its\nbase is of radius 3.5 cm, find the total\nsurface area of the article. Fig. 12.11\n12.3 Volume of a Combination of Solids\nIn the previous section, we have discussed how to find the surface area of solids made\nup of a combination of two basic solids. Here, we shall see how to calculate their\nvolumes. It may be noted that in calculating the surface area, we have not added the\nsurface areas of the two constituents, because some part of the surface area disappeared\nin the process of joining them. However, this will not be the case when we calculate\nthe volume. The volume of the solid formed by joining two basic solids will actually be\nthe sum of the volumes of the constituents, as we see in the examples below. Example 5 : Shanta runs an industry in\na shed which is in the shape of a cuboid\nsurmounted by a half cylinder (see Fig. 12.12). If the base of the shed is of\ndimension 7 m × 15 m, and the height of\nthe cuboidal portion is 8 m, find the volume\nof air that the shed can hold. Further,\nsuppose the machinery in the shed\noccupies a total space of 300 m3, and\nthere are 20 workers, each of whom\noccupy about 0.08 m3 space on an\naverage. Then, how much air is in the\nFig. 12.12\n22\nshed? (Take  = )\n7\nReprint 2025-26\n168 MATHEMATICS\nSolution : The volume of air inside the shed (when there are no people or machinery)\nis given by the volume of air inside the cuboid and inside the half cylinder, taken\ntogether. Now, the length, breadth and height of the cuboid are 15 m, 7 m and 8 m, respectively. Also, the diameter of the half cylinder is 7 m and its height is 15 m. 1\nSo, the required volume = volume of the cuboid + volume of the cylinder\n2\n 1 22 7 7 \n= 1578    15 m3 = 1128.75 m3\n \n 2 7 2 2 \nNext, the total space occupied by the machinery = 300 m3\nAnd the total space occupied by the workers = 20 × 0.08 m3 = 1.6 m3\nTherefore, the volume of the air, when there are machinery and workers\n= 1128.75 – (300.00 + 1.60) = 827.15 m3\nExample 6 : A juice seller was serving his\ncustomers using glasses as shown in Fig. 12.13. The inner diameter of the cylindrical glass was\n5 cm, but the bottom of the glass had a\nhemispherical raised portion which reduced the\ncapacity of the glass. If the height of a glass\nwas 10 cm, find the apparent capacity of the\nglass and its actual capacity. (Use  = 3.14.) Fig. 12.13\nSolution : Since the inner diameter of the glass = 5 cm and height = 10 cm,\nthe apparent capacity of the glass = r2h\n= 3.14 × 2.5 × 2.5 × 10 cm3 = 196.25 cm3\nBut the actual capacity of the glass is less by the volume of the hemisphere at the\nbase of the glass.", "2 2\ni.e., it is less by r3 = 3.142.52.5 2.5cm3 = 32.71 cm3\n3 3\nSo, the actual capacity of the glass = apparent capacity of glass – volume of the\nhemisphere\n= (196.25 – 32.71) cm3\n= 163.54 cm3\nReprint 2025-26\nSURFACE AREAS AND VOLUMES 169\nExample 7 : A solid toy is in the form of a\nhemisphere surmounted by a right circular cone. The\nheight of the cone is 2 cm and the diameter of the\nbase is 4 cm. Determine the volume of the toy. If a\nright circular cylinder circumscribes the toy, find the\ndifference of the volumes of the cylinder and the toy. (Take  = 3.14) Fig. 12.14\nSolution : Let BPC be the hemisphere and ABC be the cone standing on the base\nof the hemisphere (see Fig. 12.14). The radius BO of the hemisphere (as well as\n1\nof the cone) = × 4 cm = 2 cm. 2\n2 1\nSo, volume of the toy = r3  r2h\n3 3\n2 1 \n= 3.14(2)3 3.14(2)2 2 cm3 = 25.12 cm3\n \n3 3 \nNow, let the right circular cylinder EFGH circumscribe the given solid. The radius of\nthe base of the right circular cylinder = HP = BO = 2 cm, and its height is\nEH = AO + OP = (2 + 2) cm = 4 cm\nSo, the volume required = volume of the right circular cylinder – volume of the toy\n= (3.14 × 22 × 4 – 25.12) cm3\n= 25.12 cm3\nHence, the required difference of the two volumes = 25.12 cm3.
