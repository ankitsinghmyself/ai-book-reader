["THREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 377\n11\nChapter\nTHREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY\nv\nThe moving power of mathematical invention is not\nv\nreasoning but imagination. – A.DEMORGAN\n11.1 Introduction\nIn Class XI, while studying Analytical Geometry in two\ndimensions, and the introduction to three dimensional\ngeometry, we confined to the Cartesian methods only. In\nthe previous chapter of this book, we have studied some\nbasic concepts of vectors. We will now use vector algebra\nto three dimensional geometry. The purpose of this\napproach to 3-dimensional geometry is that it makes the\nstudy simple and elegant*. In this chapter, we shall study the direction cosines\nand direction ratios of a line joining two points and also\ndiscuss about the equations of lines and planes in space\nunder different conditions, angle between two lines, two\nLeonhard Euler\nplanes, a line and a plane, shortest distance between two\n(1707-1783)\nskew lines and distance of a point from a plane. Most of\nthe above results are obtained in vector form. Nevertheless, we shall also translate\nthese results in the Cartesian form which, at times, presents a more clear geometric\nand analytic picture of the situation. 11.2 Direction Cosines and Direction Ratios of a Line\nFrom Chapter 10, recall that if a directed line L passing through the origin makes\nangles α, β and γ with x, y and z-axes, respectively, called direction angles, then cosine\nof these angles, namely, cos α, cos β and cos γ are called direction cosines of the\ndirected line L. If we reverse the direction of L, then the direction angles are replaced by their supplements,\ni.e., , and . Thus, the signs of the direction cosines are reversed. * For various activities in three dimensional geometry, one may refer to the Book\n“A Hand Book for designing Mathematics Laboratory in Schools”, NCERT, 2005\nReprint 2025-26\n378 MATHEMATICS\nFig 11.1\nNote that a given line in space can be extended in two opposite directions and so it\nhas two sets of direction cosines. In order to have a unique set of direction cosines for\na given line in space, we must take the given line as a directed line. These unique\ndirection cosines are denoted by l, m and n. Remark If the given line in space does not pass through the origin, then, in order to find\nits direction cosines, we draw a line through the origin and parallel to the given line. Now take one of the directed lines from the origin and find its direction cosines as two\nparallel line have same set of direction cosines. Any three numbers which are proportional to the direction cosines of a line are\ncalled the direction ratios of the line. If l, m, n are direction cosines and a, b, c are\ndirection ratios of a line, then a = λl, b=λm and c = λn, for any nonzero λ ∈ R. A\nNote Some authors also call direction ratios as direction numbers. Let a, b, c be direction ratios of a line and let l, m and n be the direction cosines\n(d.c’s) of the line. Then\nl m n\n= = =k (say), k being a constant.", "a b c\nTherefore l = ak, m = bk, n = ck ... (1)\nBut l2 + m2 + n2 = 1\nTherefore k2 (a2 + b2 + c2) = 1\n1\nor k = ±\na2+b2+c2\nReprint 2025-26\nTHREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 379\nHence, from (1), the d.c.’s of the line are\na b c\nl=± ,m=± ,n=±\na2+b2+c2 a2+b2+c2 a2+b2+c2\nwhere, depending on the desired sign of k, either a positive or a negative sign is to be\ntaken for l, m and n. For any line, if a, b, c are direction ratios of a line, then ka, kb, kc; k ≠ 0 is also a\nset of direction ratios. So, any two sets of direction ratios of a line are also proportional. Also, for any line there are infinitely many sets of direction ratios. 11.2.1 Direction cosines of a line passing through two points\nSince one and only one line passes through two given points, we can determine the\ndirection cosines of a line passing through the given points P(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z )\n1 1 1 2 2 2\nas follows (Fig 11.2 (a)). Fig 11.2\nLet l, m, n be the direction cosines of the line PQ and let it makes angles α, β and γ\nwith the x, y and z-axis, respectively. Draw perpendiculars from P and Q to XY-plane to meet at R and S. Draw a\nperpendicular from P to QS to meet at N. Now, in right angle triangle PNQ, ∠PQN= γ\n(Fig 11.2 (b).

Then l = cos 900 = 0, m = cos 600 = ,\n2\n3\nn = cos 300 = . 2\nExample 2 If a line has direction ratios 2, – 1, – 2, determine its direction cosines.

Solution We know the direction cosines of the line passing through two points\nP(x , y , z ) and Q(x , y , z ) are given by\n1 1 1 2 2 2\nx − x y − y z − z\n2 1, 2 1, 2 1\nPQ PQ PQ\nwhere PQ = (x − x )2 + (y − y )2 + (z − z )2\n2 1 2 1 2 1\nHere P is (– 2, 4, – 5) and Q is (1, 2, 3). So PQ = (1− (−2))2 + (2 − 4)2 + (3− (−5))2 = 77\nThus, the direction cosines of the line joining two points is\n3 −2 8\n, ,\n77 77 77\nReprint 2025-26\nTHREE DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRY 381\nExample 4 Find the direction cosines of x, y and z-axis. Solution The x-axis makes angles 0°, 90° and 90° respectively with x, y and z-axis. Therefore, the direction cosines of x-axis are cos 0°, cos 90°, cos 90° i.e., 1,0,0.", "Similarly, direction cosines of y-axis and z-axis are 0, 1, 0 and 0, 0, 1 respectively. Example 5 Show that the points A (2, 3, – 4), B (1, – 2, 3) and C (3, 8, – 11) are\ncollinear. Solution Direction ratios of line joining A and B are\n1 – 2, – 2 – 3, 3 + 4 i.e., – 1, – 5, 7. The direction ratios of line joining B and C are\n3 –1, 8 + 2, – 11 – 3, i.e., 2, 10, – 14. It is clear that direction ratios of AB and BC are proportional, hence, AB is parallel\nto BC. But point B is common to both AB and BC. Therefore, A, B, C are\ncollinear points. EXERCISE 11.1\n1.

Find the direction cosines of the sides of the triangle whose vertices are\n(3, 5, – 4), (– 1, 1, 2) and (– 5, – 5, – 2). 11.3 Equation of a Line in Space\nWe have studied equation of lines in two dimensions in Class XI, we shall now study\nthe vector and cartesian equations of a line in space. A line is uniquely determined if\n(i) it passes through a given point and has given direction, or\n(ii) it passes through two given points. 11.3.1 Equation of a line through a given point and parallel to given vector\nLet be the position vector of the given point A with respect to the origin O of the\nrectangular coordinate system. Let l be the line which passes through the point A and\nis parallel to a given vector . Let be the position vector of an arbitrary point P on the\nline (Fig 11.3).

Here, b should not be confused with | |. Derivation of cartesian form from vector form\nLet the coordinates of the given point A be (x , y , z ) and the direction ratios of\n1 1 1\nthe line be a, b, c. Consider the coordinates of any point P be (x, y, z). Then\nr r\nr = xˆ i + yˆ j+ zkˆ; a = x ˆ i + y ˆ j + z kˆ\n1 1 1\nr\nand b = a iˆ + b ˆj + c kˆ\niˆ, ˆj kˆ\nSubstituting these values in (1) and equating the coefficients of and , we get\nx = x + λa; y = y + λ b; z = z + λc ...

Let P be a point on L and Q be a point\n1\non L . Consider the directed lines OP and OQ as\n2\ngiven in Fig 11.6. Let θ be the acute angle between\nOP and OQ. Now recall that the directed line\nsegments OP and OQ are vectors with components\na , b , c and a , b , c , respectively.

If instead of direction ratios for the lines L and L , direction cosines, namely,\n1 2\nl , m , n for L and l , m , n for L are given, then (1) and (2) takes the following form:\n1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2\ncos θ = |l l + m m + n n | (as l2+m2+n2=1 =l2+m2+n2) ...

Also, if two lines in space are parallel,\nthen the shortest distance between them\nwill be the perpendicular distance, i.e. the\nlength of the perpendicular drawn from a\npoint on one line onto the other line. Further, in a space, there are lines which\nare neither intersecting nor parallel. In fact,\nsuch pair of lines are non coplanar and\nare called skew lines. For example, let us\nconsider a room of size 1, 3, 2 units along Fig 11.5\nx, y and z-axes respectively Fig 11.5. Reprint 2025-26\n386 MATHEMATICS\nThe line GE that goes diagonally across the ceiling and the line DB passes through\none corner of the ceiling directly above A and goes diagonally down the wall. These\nlines are skew because they are not parallel and also never meet. By the shortest distance between two lines we mean the join of a point in one line\nwith one point on the other line so that the length of the segment so obtained is the\nsmallest. For skew lines, the line of the shortest distance will be perpendicular to both\nthe lines. 11.5.1 Distance between two skew lines\nWe now determine the shortest distance between two skew lines in the following way:\nLet l and l be two skew lines with equations (Fig. 11.6)\n1 2 r r\n= a +λ b ...
