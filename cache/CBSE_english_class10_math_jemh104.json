["38 MATHEMATICS\n4\nQ E\nUADRATIC QUATIONS\n4.1 Introduction\nIn Chapter 2, you have studied different types of polynomials. One type was the\nquadratic polynomial of the form ax2 + bx + c, a  0. When we equate this polynomial\nto zero, we get a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations come up when we deal with\nmany real-life situations. For instance, suppose a\ncharity trust decides to build a prayer hall having\na carpet area of 300 square metres with its length\none metre more than twice its breadth. What\nshould be the length and breadth of the hall? Suppose the breadth of the hall is x metres. Then,\nits length should be (2x + 1) metres. We can depict\nFig. 4.1\nthis information pictorially as shown in Fig. 4.1. Now, area of the hall = (2x + 1). x m2 = (2x2 + x) m2\nSo, 2x2 + x = 300 (Given)\nTherefore, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0\nSo, the breadth of the hall should satisfy the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 which is a\nquadratic equation. Many people believe that Babylonians were the first to solve quadratic equations. For instance, they knew how to find two positive numbers with a given positive sum\nand a given positive product, and this problem is equivalent to solving a quadratic\nequation of the form x2 – px + q = 0. Greek mathematician Euclid developed a\ngeometrical approach for finding out lengths which, in our present day terminology,\nare solutions of quadratic equations. Solving of quadratic equations, in general form, is\noften credited to ancient Indian mathematicians. In fact, Brahmagupta (C.E.598–665)\ngave an explicit formula to solve a quadratic equation of the form ax2 + bx = c. Later,\nReprint 2025-26\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 39\nSridharacharya (C.E. 1025) derived a formula, now known as the quadratic formula,\n(as quoted by Bhaskara II) for solving a quadratic equation by the method of completing\nthe square. An Arab mathematician Al-Khwarizmi (about C.E. 800) also studied\nquadratic equations of different types. Abraham bar Hiyya Ha-Nasi, in his book\n‘Liber embadorum’ published in Europe in C.E. 1145 gave complete solutions of\ndifferent quadratic equations. In this chapter, you will study quadratic equations, and various ways of finding\ntheir roots. You will also see some applications of quadratic equations in daily life\nsituations. 4.2 Quadratic Equations\nA quadratic equation in the variable x is an equation of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where\na, b, c are real numbers, a  0. For example, 2x2 + x – 300 = 0 is a quadratic equation. Similarly, 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0, 4x – 3x2 + 2 = 0 and 1 – x2 + 300 = 0 are also quadratic\nequations. In fact, any equation of the form p(x) = 0, where p(x) is a polynomial of degree\n2, is a quadratic equation. But when we write the terms of p(x) in descending order of\ntheir degrees, then we get the standard form of the equation. That is, ax2 + bx + c = 0,\na  0 is called the standard form of a quadratic equation. Quadratic equations arise in several situations in the world around us and in\ndifferent fields of mathematics.", "Let us consider a few examples. Example 1 : Represent the following situations mathematically:\n(i) John and Jivanti together have 45 marbles. Both of them lost 5 marbles each, and\nthe product of the number of marbles they now have is 124. We would like to find\nout how many marbles they had to start with. (ii) A cottage industry produces a certain number of toys in a day. The cost of\nproduction of each toy (in rupees) was found to be 55 minus the number of toys\nproduced in a day. On a particular day, the total cost of production was\n` 750. We would like to find out the number of toys produced on that day. Solution :\n(i) Let the number of marbles John had be x. Then the number of marbles Jivanti had = 45 – x (Why?). The number of marbles left with John, when he lost 5 marbles = x – 5\nThe number of marbles left with Jivanti, when she lost 5 marbles = 45 – x – 5\n= 40 – x\nReprint 2025-26\n40 MATHEMATICS\nTherefore, their product = (x – 5) (40 – x)\n= 40x – x2 – 200 + 5x\n= – x2 + 45x – 200\nSo, – x2 + 45x – 200 = 124 (Given that product = 124)\ni.e., – x2 + 45x – 324 = 0\ni.e., x2 – 45x + 324 = 0\nTherefore, the number of marbles John had, satisfies the quadratic equation\nx2 – 45x + 324 = 0\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically. (ii) Let the number of toys produced on that day be x. Therefore, the cost of production (in rupees) of each toy that day = 55 – x\nSo, the total cost of production (in rupees) that day = x (55 – x)\nTherefore, x (55 – x) = 750\ni.e., 55x – x2 = 750\ni.e., – x2 + 55x – 750 = 0\ni.e., x2 – 55x + 750 = 0\nTherefore, the number of toys produced that day satisfies the quadratic equation\nx2 – 55x + 750 = 0\nwhich is the required representation of the problem mathematically. Example 2 : Check whether the following are quadratic equations:\n(i) (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3 (ii) x(x + 1) + 8 = (x + 2) (x – 2)\n(iii) x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 (iv) (x + 2)3 = x3 – 4\nSolution :\n(i) LHS = (x – 2)2 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 4 + 1 = x2 – 4x + 5\nTherefore, (x – 2)2 + 1 = 2x – 3 can be rewritten as\nx2 – 4x + 5 = 2x – 3\ni.e., x2 – 6x + 8 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. Therefore, the given equation is a quadratic equation. Reprint 2025-26\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 41\n(ii) Since x(x + 1) + 8 = x2 + x + 8 and (x + 2)(x – 2) = x2 – 4\nTherefore, x2 + x + 8 = x2 – 4\ni.e., x + 12 = 0\nIt is not of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. Therefore, the given equation is not a quadratic equation. (iii) Here, LHS = x (2x + 3) = 2x2 + 3x\nSo, x (2x + 3) = x2 + 1 can be rewritten as\n2x2 + 3x = x2 + 1\nTherefore, we get x2 + 3x – 1 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. So, the given equation is a quadratic equation. (iv) Here, LHS = (x + 2)3 = x3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8\nTherefore, (x + 2)3 = x3 – 4 can be rewritten as\nx3 + 6x2 + 12x + 8 = x3 – 4\ni.e., 6x2 + 12x + 12 = 0 or, x2 + 2x + 2 = 0\nIt is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0. So, the given equation is a quadratic equation. Remark : Be careful!", "In (ii) above, the given equation appears to be a quadratic\nequation, but it is not a quadratic equation. In (iv) above, the given equation appears to be a cubic equation (an equation of\ndegree 3) and not a quadratic equation. But it turns out to be a quadratic equation. As\nyou can see, often we need to simplify the given equation before deciding whether it\nis quadratic or not. EXERCISE 4.1\n1. Check whether the following are quadratic equations :\n(i) (x + 1)2 = 2(x – 3) (ii) x2 – 2x = (–2) (3 – x)\n(iii) (x – 2)(x + 1) = (x – 1)(x + 3) (iv) (x – 3)(2x +1) = x(x + 5)\n(v) (2x – 1)(x – 3) = (x + 5)(x – 1) (vi) x2 + 3x + 1 = (x – 2)2\n(vii) (x + 2)3 = 2x (x2 – 1) (viii) x3 – 4x2 – x + 1 = (x – 2)3\n2. Represent the following situations in the form of quadratic equations :\n(i) The area of a rectangular plot is 528 m2. The length of the plot (in metres) is one\nmore than twice its breadth. We need to find the length and breadth of the plot. Reprint 2025-26\n42 MATHEMATICS\n(ii) The product of two consecutive positive integers is 306. We need to find the\nintegers. (iii) Rohan’s mother is 26 years older than him. The product of their ages (in years)\n3 years from now will be 360. We would like to find Rohan’s present age. (iv) A train travels a distance of 480 km at a uniform speed. If the speed had been\n8 km/h less, then it would have taken 3 hours more to cover the same distance. We\nneed to find the speed of the train. 4.3 Solution of a Quadratic Equation by Factorisation\nConsider the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. If we replace x by 1 on the\nLHS of this equation, we get (2 × 12) – (3 × 1) + 1 = 0 = RHS of the equation. We say that 1 is a root of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 3x + 1 = 0. This also means that\n1 is a zero of the quadratic polynomial 2x2 – 3x + 1. In general, a real number  is called a root of the quadratic equation\nax2 + bx + c = 0, a  0 if a 2 + b + c = 0. We also say that x =  is a solution of\nthe quadratic equation, or that  satisfies the quadratic equation. Note that the\nzeroes of the quadratic polynomial ax2 + bx + c and the roots of the quadratic\nequation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are the same. You have observed, in Chapter 2, that a quadratic polynomial can have at most\ntwo zeroes. So, any quadratic equation can have atmost two roots. You have learnt in Class IX, how to factorise quadratic polynomials by splitting\ntheir middle terms. We shall use this knowledge for finding the roots of a quadratic\nequation. Let us see how. Example 3 : Find the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0, by factorisation. Solution : Let us first split the middle term – 5x as –2x –3x [because (–2x) × (–3x) =\n6x2 = (2x2) × 3]. So, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 2x2 – 2x – 3x + 3 = 2x (x – 1) –3(x – 1) = (2x – 3)(x – 1)\nNow, 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 can be rewritten as (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0. So, the values of x for which 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 are the same for which (2x – 3)(x – 1) = 0,\ni.e., either 2x – 3 = 0 or x – 1 = 0. 3\nNow, 2x – 3 = 0 gives x and x – 1 = 0 gives x = 1.", "2\n3\nSo, x and x = 1 are the solutions of the equation. 2\n3\nIn other words, 1 and are the roots of the equation 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0. 2\nVerify that these are the roots of the given equation. Reprint 2025-26\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 43\nNote that we have found the roots of 2x2 – 5x + 3 = 0 by factorising\n2x2 – 5x + 3 into two linear factors and equating each factor to zero. Example 4 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 6x2 – x – 2 = 0. Solution : We have\n6x2 – x – 2 =6x2 + 3x – 4x – 2\n=3x (2x + 1) – 2 (2x + 1)\n=(3x – 2)(2x + 1)\nThe roots of 6x2 – x – 2 = 0 are the values of x for which (3x – 2)(2x + 1) = 0\nTherefore, 3x – 2 = 0 or 2x + 1 = 0,\n2 1\ni.e., x = or x = \n3 2\n2 1\nTherefore, the roots of 6x2 – x – 2 = 0 are and – . 3 2\n2 1\nWe verify the roots, by checking that and  satisfy 6x2 – x – 2 = 0. 3 2\nExample 5 : Find the roots of the quadratic equation 3x2 2 6x20. Solution :3x2 2 6x2 = 3x2  6x 6x2\n   \n= 3x 3x 2  2 3x  2\n  \n= 3x  2 3x  2\nSo, the roots of the equation are the values of x for which\n  \n3x 2 3x  2 0\n2\nNow, 3x 2 0 for x . 3\nSo, this root is repeated twice, one for each repeated factor 3x 2. 2 2\nTherefore, the roots of 3x2 2 6x20 are , . 3 3\nReprint 2025-26\n44 MATHEMATICS\nExample 6 : Find the dimensions of the prayer hall discussed in Section 4.1. Solution : In Section 4.1, we found that if the breadth of the hall is x m, then x\nsatisfies the equation 2x2 + x – 300 = 0. Applying the factorisation method, we write\nthis equation as\n2x2 – 24x + 25x – 300 = 0\n2x (x – 12) + 25 (x – 12) = 0\ni.e., (x – 12)(2x + 25) = 0\nSo, the roots of the given equation are x = 12 or x = – 12.5. Since x is the breadth\nof the hall, it cannot be negative. Thus, the breadth of the hall is 12 m. Its length = 2x + 1 = 25 m. EXERCISE 4.2\n1.

It was observed\non a particular day that the cost of production of each article (in rupees) was 3 more than\ntwice the number of articles produced on that day. If the total cost of production on that\nday was ` 90, find the number of articles produced and the cost of each article. 4.4 Nature of Roots\nThe equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are given by\n–b b24ac\nx =\n2a\nb b2  4ac\nIf b2 – 4ac > 0, we get two distinct real roots   and\n2a 2a\nb b2 4ac\n – .", "2a 2a\nReprint 2025-26\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 45\nb b b\nIf b2 – 4ac = 0, then x =   0, i.e., x   or – \n2a 2a 2a\nb\nSo, the roots of the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are both \n2a\nTherefore, we say that the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has two equal\nreal roots in this case. If b2 – 4ac < 0, then there is no real number whose square is b2 – 4ac. Therefore,\nthere are no real roots for the given quadratic equation in this case. Since b2 – 4ac determines whether the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has\nreal roots or not, b2 – 4ac is called the discriminant of this quadratic equation. So, a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 has\n(i) two distinct real roots, if b2 – 4ac > 0,\n(ii) two equal real roots, if b2 – 4ac = 0,\n(iii) no real roots, if b2 – 4ac < 0. Let us consider some examples. Example 7: Find the discriminant of the quadratic equation 2x2 – 4x + 3 = 0, and\nhence find the nature of its roots. Solution : The given equation is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 2, b = – 4 and\nc = 3. Therefore, the discriminant\nb2 – 4ac = (– 4)2 – (4 × 2 × 3) = 16 – 24 = – 8 < 0\nSo, the given equation has no real roots. Example 8 : A pole has to be erected at a point on the boundary of a circular park of\ndiameter 13 metres in such a way that the differences of its distances from two\ndiametrically opposite fixed gates A and B on the boundary is 7 metres. Is it possible to\ndo so? If yes, at what distances from the two gates should the pole be erected? Solution : Let us first draw the diagram\n(see Fig. 4.2). Let P be the required location of the\npole. Let the distance of the pole from the\ngate B be x m, i.e., BP = x m. Now the\ndifference of the distances of the pole from\nthe two gates = AP – BP (or, BP – AP) =\n7 m. Therefore, AP = (x + 7) m. Fig. 4.2\nReprint 2025-26\n46 MATHEMATICS\nNow, AB = 13m, and since AB is a diameter,\nAPB = 90° (Why?)\nTherefore, AP2 + PB2 = AB2 (By Pythagoras theorem)\ni.e., (x + 7)2 + x2 = 132\ni.e., x2 + 14x + 49 + x2 = 169\ni.e., 2x2 + 14x – 120 = 0\nSo, the distance ‘x’ of the pole from gate B satisfies the equation\nx2 + 7x – 60 = 0\nSo, it would be possible to place the pole if this equation has real roots. To see if this\nis so or not, let us consider its discriminant. The discriminant is\nb2 – 4ac = 72 – 4 × 1 × (– 60) = 289 > 0. So, the given quadratic equation has two real roots, and it is possible to erect the\npole on the boundary of the park. Solving the quadratic equation x2 + 7x – 60 = 0, by the quadratic formula, we get\n7  289 7 17\nx = =\n2 2\nTherefore, x = 5 or – 12. Since x is the distance between the pole and the gate B, it must be positive. Therefore, x = – 12 will have to be ignored. So, x = 5. Thus, the pole has to be erected on the boundary of the park at a distance of 5m\nfrom the gate B and 12m from the gate A. 1\nExample 9 : Find the discriminant of the equation 3x2 – 2x + = 0 and hence find the\n3\nnature of its roots. Find them, if they are real. 1\nSolution : Here a = 3, b = – 2 and c .", "3\n1\nTherefore, discriminant b2 – 4ac = (– 2)2 – 4 × 3 × = 4 – 4 = 0. 3\nHence, the given quadratic equation has two equal real roots. b b 2 2 1 1\nThe roots are , , i.e., , , i.e., , . 2a 2a 6 6 3 3\nReprint 2025-26\nQUADRATIC EQUATIONS 47\nEXERCISE 4.3\n1.

Is it possible to design a rectangular park of perimeter 80 m and area 400 m2? If so, find\nits length and breadth. 4.5 Summary\nIn this chapter, you have studied the following points:\n1. A quadratic equation in the variable x is of the form ax2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real\nnumbers and a  0. 2. A real number  is said to be a root of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, if\na2 + b + c = 0.

If we can factorise ax2 + bx + c, a  0, into a product of two linear factors, then the roots\nof the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 can be found by equating each factor to zero. 4.
