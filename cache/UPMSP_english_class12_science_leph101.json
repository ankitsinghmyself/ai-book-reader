["Chapter One\nELECTRIC CHARGES\nAND FIELDS\n1.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nAll of us have the experience of seeing a spark or hearing a crackle when\nwe take off our synthetic clothes or sweater, particularly in dry weather. Have you ever tried to find any explanation for this phenomenon? Another\ncommon example of electric discharge is the lightning that we see in the\nsky during thunderstorms. We also experience a sensation of an electric\nshock either while opening the door of a car or holding the iron bar of a\nbus after sliding from our seat. The reason for these experiences is\ndischarge of electric charges through our body, which were accumulated\ndue to rubbing of insulating surfaces. You might have also heard that\nthis is due to generation of static electricity. This is precisely the topic we\nare going to discuss in this and the next chapter. Static means anything\nthat does not move or change with time. Electrostatics deals with\nthe study of forces, fields and potentials arising from\nstatic charges. 1.2 E C\nLECTRIC HARGE\nHistorically the credit of discovery of the fact that amber rubbed with\nwool or silk cloth attracts light objects goes to Thales of Miletus, Greece,\naround 600 BC. The name electricity is coined from the Greek word\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nFIGURE 1.1 Rods: like charges repel and unlike charges attract each other. elektron meaning amber. Many such pairs of materials were known which\non rubbing could attract light objects like straw, pith balls and bits of\npapers. It was observed that if two glass rods rubbed with wool or silk cloth\nare brought close to each other, they repel each other [Fig. 1.1(a)]. The\ntwo strands of wool or two pieces of silk cloth, with which the rods were\nrubbed, also repel each other. However, the glass rod and wool attracted\neach other. Similarly, two plastic rods rubbed with cat’s fur repelled each\nother [Fig. 1.1(b)] but attracted the fur. On the other hand, the plastic\nrod attracts the glass rod [Fig. 1.1(c)] and repel the silk or wool with\nwhich the glass rod is rubbed. The glass rod repels the fur. These seemingly simple facts were established from years of efforts\nand careful experiments and their analyses. It was concluded, after many\ncareful studies by different scientists, that there were only two kinds of\nan entry which is called the electric charge. We say that the bodies like\nglass or plastic rods, silk, fur and pith balls are electrified. They acquire\nan electric charge on rubbing. There are two kinds of electrification and\nwe find that (i) like charges repel and (ii) unlike charges attract each\nother. The property which differentiates the two kinds of charges is called\nthe polarity of charge. When a glass rod is rubbed with silk, the rod acquires one kind of\ncharge and the silk acquires the second kind of charge. This is true for\nany pair of objects that are rubbed to be electrified. Now if the electrified\nglass rod is brought in contact with silk, with which it was rubbed, they\nno longer attract each other.", "They also do not attract or repel other light\nobjects as they did on being electrified. Thus, the charges acquired after rubbing are lost when the charged\nbodies are brought in contact. What can you conclude from these\nobservations? It just tells us that unlike charges acquired by the objects\nneutralise or nullify each other’s effect. Therefore, the charges were named\nas positive and negative by the American scientist Benjamin Franklin. By convention, the charge on glass rod or cat’s fur is called positive and\nthat on plastic rod or silk is termed negative. If an object possesses an\nelectric charge, it is said to be electrified or charged. When it has no charge\nit is said to be electrically neutral. 2\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\nA simple apparatus to detect charge on a body is the gold-leaf\nelectroscope [Fig. 1.2(a)]. It consists of a vertical metal rod housed in a\nbox, with two thin gold leaves attached to its bottom end. When a charged\nobject touches the metal knob at the top of the rod, charge flows on to\nthe leaves and they diverge. The degree of divergance is an indicator of\nthe amount of charge. Try to understand why material bodies acquire charge. You know that\nall matter is made up of atoms and/or molecules. Although normally the\nmaterials are electrically neutral, they do contain charges; but their charges\nare exactly balanced. Forces that hold the molecules together, forces that\nhold atoms together in a solid, the adhesive force of glue, forces associated\nwith surface tension, all are basically electrical in nature, arising from the\nforces between charged particles. Thus the electric force is all pervasive and\nit encompasses almost each and every field associated with our life. It is\ntherefore essential that we learn more about such a force. To electrify a neutral body, we need to add or remove one kind of\ncharge. When we say that a body is charged, we always refer to this\nexcess charge or deficit of charge. In solids, some of the electrons, being\nless tightly bound in the atom, are the charges which are transferred\nfrom one body to the other. A body can thus be charged positively by\nlosing some of its electrons. Similarly, a body can be charged negatively\nby gaining electrons. When we rub a glass rod with silk, some of the\nelectrons from the rod are transferred to the silk cloth. Thus the rod gets\npositively charged and the silk gets negatively charged. No new charge is\ncreated in the process of rubbing. Also the number of electrons, that are\ntransferred, is a very small fraction of the total number of electrons in the\nmaterial body. 1.3 C I\nONDUCTORS AND NSULATORS\nSome substances readily allow passage of electricity through them, others\ndo not. Those which allow electricity to pass through them easily are\ncalled conductors. They have electric charges (electrons) that are\ncomparatively free to move inside the material. Metals, human and animal\nbodies and earth are conductors.", "Most of the non-metals like glass,\nporcelain, plastic, nylon, wood offer high resistance to the passage of\nelectricity through them. They are called insulators. Most substances\nfall into one of the two classes stated above*. When some charge is transferred to a conductor, it readily gets\ndistributed over the entire surface of the conductor. In contrast, if some\ncharge is put on an insulator, it stays at the same place. You will learn\nwhy this happens in the next chapter. This property of the materials tells you why a nylon or plastic comb\ngets electrified on combing dry hair or on rubbing, but a metal article\n* There is a third category called semiconductors, which offer resistance to the\nmovement of charges which is intermediate between the conductors and\ninsulators. 3\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nlike spoon does not. The charges on metal leak through\nour body to the ground as both are conductors of\nelectricity. However, if a metal rod with a wooden or plastic\nhandle is rubbed without touching its metal part, it shows\nsigns of charging. 1.4 B P E\nASIC ROPERTIES OF LECTRIC\nC\nHARGE\nWe have seen that there are two types of charges, namely\npositive and negative and their effects tend to cancel each\nother. Here, we shall now describe some other properties\nof the electric charge. If the sizes of charged bodies are very small as\ncompared to the distances between them, we treat them\nas point charges. All the charge content of the body is\nassumed to be concentrated at one point in space. 1.4.1 Additivity of charges\nWe have not as yet given a quantitative definition of a\nFIGURE 1.2 Electroscopes: (a)\nThe gold leaf electroscope, (b) charge; we shall follow it up in the next section. We shall\nSchematics of a simple tentatively assume that this can be done and proceed. If\nelectroscope. a system contains two point charges q and q , the total\n1 2\ncharge of the system is obtained simply by adding\nalgebraically q and q ,i.e., charges add up like real numbers or they\n1 2\nare scalars like the mass of a body. If a system contains n charges q ,\n1\nq , q , …, q , then the total charge of the system is q + q + q + … + q\n2 3 n 1 2 3 n\n. Charge has magnitude but no direction, similar to mass. However,\nthere is one difference between mass and charge. Mass of a body is\nalways positive whereas a charge can be either positive or negative. Proper signs have to be used while adding the charges in a system. For\nexample, the total charge of a system containing five charges +1, +2, –3,\n+4 and –5, in some arbitrary unit, is (+1) + (+2) + (–3) + (+4) + (–5) = –1 in\nthe same unit. 1.4.2 Charge is conserved\nWe have already hinted to the fact that when bodies are charged by\nrubbing, there is transfer of electrons from one body to the other; no new\ncharges are either created or destroyed. A picture of particles of electric\ncharge enables us to understand the idea of conservation of charge. When\nwe rub two bodies, what one body gains in charge the other body loses.", "Within an isolated system consisting of many charged bodies, due to\ninteractions among the bodies, charges may get redistributed but it is\nfound that the total charge of the isolated system is always conserved. Conservation of charge has been established experimentally. It is not possible to create or destroy net charge carried by any isolated\nsystem although the charge carrying particles may be created or destroyed\n4\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\nin a process. Sometimes nature creates charged particles: a neutron turns\ninto a proton and an electron. The proton and electron thus created have\nequal and opposite charges and the total charge is zero before and after\nthe creation. 1.4.3 Quantisation of charge\nExperimentally it is established that all free charges are integral multiples\nof a basic unit of charge denoted by e. Thus charge q on a body is always\ngiven by\nq = ne\nwhere n is any integer, positive or negative. This basic unit of charge is\nthe charge that an electron or proton carries. By convention, the charge\non an electron is taken to be negative; therefore charge on an electron is\nwritten as –e and that on a proton as +e. The fact that electric charge is always an integral multiple of e is termed\nas quantisation of charge. There are a large number of situations in physics\nwhere certain physical quantities are quantised. The quantisation of charge\nwas first suggested by the experimental laws of electrolysis discovered by\nEnglish experimentalist Faraday. It was experimentally demonstrated by\nMillikan in 1912. In the International System (SI) of Units, a unit of charge is called a\ncoulomb and is denoted by the symbol C. A coulomb is defined in terms\nthe unit of the electric current which you are going to learn in a\nsubsequent chapter. In terms of this definition, one coulomb is the charge\nflowing through a wire in 1 s if the current is 1 A (ampere), (see Chapter 1\nof Class XI, Physics Textbook , Part I). In this system, the value of the\nbasic unit of charge is\ne = 1.602192 × 10–19 C\nThus, there are about 6 × 1018 electrons in a charge of –1C. In\nelectrostatics, charges of this large magnitude are seldom encountered\nand hence we use smaller units 1 mC (micro coulomb) = 10–6 C or 1 mC\n(milli coulomb) = 10–3 C. If the protons and electrons are the only basic charges in the\nuniverse, all the observable charges have to be integral multiples of e. Thus, if a body contains n electrons and n protons, the total amount\n1 2\nof charge on the body is n × e + n × (–e) = (n – n ) e. Since n and n\n2 1 2 1 1 2\nare integers, their difference is also an integer. Thus the charge on any\nbody is always an integral multiple of e and can be increased or\ndecreased also in steps of e. The step size e is, however, very small because at the macroscopic\nlevel, we deal with charges of a few mC. At this scale the fact that charge of\na body can increase or decrease in units of e is not visible.", "In this respect,\nthe grainy nature of the charge is lost and it appears to be continuous. This situation can be compared with the geometrical concepts of points\nand lines. A dotted line viewed from a distance appears continuous to\nus but is not continuous in reality. As many points very close to\n5\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n6\n1.1\nELPMAXE\n2.1\nELPMAXE\neach other normally give an impression of a continuous line, many\nsmall charges taken together appear as a continuous charge distribution. At the macroscopic level, one deals with charges that are enormous\ncompared to the magnitude of charge e. Since e = 1.6 × 10–19 C, a charge\nof magnituOde, say 1 mC, contains something like 1013 times the electronic\ncharge. At this scale, the fact that charge can increase or decrease only in\nunits of e is not very different from saying that charge can take continuous\nvalues. Thus, at the macroscopic level, the quantisation of charge has no\npractical consequence and can be ignored. However, at the microscopic\nlevel, where the charges involved are of the order of a few tens or hundreds\nof e, i.e., they can be counted, they appear in discrete lumps and\nquantisation of charge cannot be ignored. It is the magnitude of scale\ninvolved that is very important. Example 1.1 If 109 electrons move out of a body to another body\nevery second, how much time is required to get a total charge of 1 C\non the other body? Solution In one second 109 electrons move out of the body. Therefore\nthe charge given out in one second is 1.6 × 10–19 × 109 C = 1.6 × 10–10 C. The time required to accumulate a charge of 1 C can then be estimated\nto be 1 C ÷ (1.6 × 10–10 C/s) = 6.25 × 109 s = 6.25 × 109 ÷ (365 × 24 ×\n3600) years = 198 years. Thus to collect a charge of one coulomb,\nfrom a body from which 109 electrons move out every second, we will\nneed approximately 200 years. One coulomb is, therefore, a very large\nunit for many practical purposes. It is, however, also important to know what is roughly the number of\nelectrons contained in a piece of one cubic centimetre of a material. A cubic piece of copper of side 1 cm contains about 2.5 × 1024\nelectrons. Example 1.2 How much positive and negative charge is there in a\ncup of water? Solution Let us assume that the mass of one cup of water is\n250 g. The molecular mass of water is 18g. Thus, one mole\n(= 6.02 × 1023 molecules) of water is 18 g. Therefore the number of\nmolecules in one cup of water is (250/18) × 6.02 × 1023. Each molecule of water contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen\natom, i.e., 10 electrons and 10 protons. Hence the total positive and\ntotal negative charge has the same magnitude. It is equal to\n(250/18) × 6.02 × 1023 × 10 × 1.6 × 10–19 C = 1.34 × 107 C. 1.5 C ’ L\nOULOMB S AW\nCoulomb’s law is a quantitative statement about the force between two\npoint charges. When the linear size of charged bodies are much smaller\nthan the distance separating them, the size may be ignored and the\ncharged bodies are treated as point charges.", "Coulomb measured the\nforce between two point charges and found that it varied inversely as\nthe square of the distance between the charges and was directly\nproportional to the product of the magnitude of the two charges and\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\nacted along the line joining the two charges. Thus, if two\npoint charges q , q are separated by a distance r in vacuum,\n1 2\nthe magnitude of the force (F) between them is given by\nq q\nF =k 1 2 (1.1)\nr2\nHow did Coulomb arrive at this law from his experiments? Coulomb used a torsion balance* for measuring the force\nbetween two charged metallic spheres. When the separation\nbetween two spheres is much larger than the radius of each\nsphere, the charged spheres may be regarded as point charges. However, the charges on the spheres were unknown, to begin\nwith. How then could he discover a relation like Eq. (1.1)? Charles Augustin de\nCoulomb thought of the following simple way: Suppose the\nCoulomb (1736 – 1806)\ncharge on a metallic sphere is q.

How to calculate the force on a charge where\nthere are not one but several charges around? Consider a\nsystem of n stationary charges q , q , q , ..., q in vacuum. 1 2 3 n\nWhat is the force on q due to q , q , ..., q ? Coulomb’s law is\n1 2 3 n\nnot enough to answer this question. Recall that forces of\nmechanical origin add according to the parallelogram law of\naddition. Is the same true for forces of electrostatic origin? Experimentally, it is verified that force on any charge due\nto a number of other charges is the vector sum of all the forces\non that charge due to the other charges, taken one at a time. The individual forces are unaffected due to the presence of\nother charges. This is termed as the principle of superposition. To better understand the concept, consider a system of\nthree charges q q and q , as shown in Fig. 1.5(a). The force\n1, 2 3\non one charge, say q , due to two other charges q , q can\n1 2 3\ntherefore be obtained by performing a vector addition of the\nforces due to each one of these charges. Thus, if the force on q\n1\ndue to q is denoted by F , F is given by Eq. (1.3) even\n2 12 12\nthough other charges are present.

It follows straight from the fact\nthat Coulomb’s law is consistent with Newton’s third law. The proof\nis left to you as an exercise. 1.7 E F\nLECTRIC IELD\nLet us consider a point charge Q placed in vacuum, at the origin O. If we\nplace another point charge q at a point P, where OP = r, then the charge Q\nwill exert a force on q as per Coulomb’s law. We may ask the question: If\ncharge q is removed, then what is left in the surrounding? Is there\nnothing? If there is nothing at the point P, then how does a force act\nwhen we place the charge q at P. In order to answer such questions, the\nearly scientists introduced the concept of field. According to this, we say\nthat the charge Q produces an electric field everywhere in the surrounding. When another charge q is brought at some point P, the field there acts on\nit and produces a force. The electric field produced by the charge Q at a\npoint r is given as\nE ( r )= 1 Q rˆ = 1 Q rˆ\n4p ε r2 4p ε r2 (1.6)\n0 0\nwhere rˆ = r/r, is a unit vector from the origin to the point r. Thus, Eq.(1.6)\nspecifies the value of the electric field for each value of the position\nvector r. The word “field” signifies how some distributed quantity (which\ncould be a scalar or a vector) varies with position. The effect of the charge\nhas been incorporated in the existence of the electric field. We obtain the\nforce Fexerted by acharge Q on a charge q, as\n1 Qq\nF = rˆ\n4p ε r2 (1.7)\n0\nNote that the charge q also exerts an equal and opposite force on the\ncharge Q. The electrostatic force between the charges Q and q can be\nlooked upon as an interaction between charge q and the electric field of\nQ and vice versa. If we denote the position of charge q by the vector r, it\nexperiences a force F equal to the charge q multiplied by the electric\nfield E at the location of q. Thus,\nF(r) = q E(r) (1.8)\nEquation (1.8) defines the SI unit of electric field as N/C*. Some important remarks may be made here:\n(i) From Eq. (1.8), we can infer that if q is unity, the electric field due to\na charge Q is numerically equal to the force exerted by it. Thus, the\nFIGURE 1.8 Electric\nfield (a) due to a electric field due to a charge Q at a point in space may be defined\ncharge Q, (b) due to a as the force that a unit positive charge would experience if placed\ncharge –Q. * An alternate unit V/m will be introduced in the next chapter. Reprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\nat that point.", "The charge Q, which is producing the electric field, is\ncalled a source charge and the charge q, which tests the effect of a\nsource charge, is called a test charge. Note that the source charge Q\nmust remain at its original location. However, if a charge q is brought\nat any point around Q, Q itself is bound to experience an electrical\nforce due to q and will tend to move. A way out of this difficulty is to\nmake q negligibly small. The force F is then negligibly small but the\nratio F/q is finite and defines the electric field:\n(cid:230) (cid:246)\nF\nE = lim(cid:231) (cid:247) (1.9)\nqfi 0 Ł qł\nA practical way to get around the problem (of keeping Q undisturbed\nin the presence of q) is to hold Q to its location by unspecified forces! This may look strange but actually this is what happens in practice. When we are considering the electric force on a test charge q due to a\ncharged planar sheet (Section 1.14), the charges on the sheet are held to\ntheir locations by the forces due to the unspecified charged constituents\ninside the sheet. (ii) Note that the electric field E due to Q, though defined operationally in\nterms of some test charge q, is independent of q. This is because\nF is proportional to q, so the ratio F/q does not depend on q. The\nforce F on the charge q due to the charge Q depends on the particular\nlocation of charge q which may take any value in the space around\nthe charge Q. Thus, the electric field E due to Q is also dependent on\nthe space coordinate r. For different positions of the charge q all over\nthe space, we get different values of electric field E. The field exists at\nevery point in three-dimensional space. (iii) For a positive charge, the electric field will be directed radially\noutwards from the charge. On the other hand, if the source charge is\nnegative, the electric field vector, at each point, points radially inwards. (iv) Since the magnitude of the force F on charge q due to charge Q\ndepends only on the distance r of the charge q from charge Q,\nthe magnitude of the electric field E will also depend only on the\ndistance r. Thus at equal distances from the charge Q, the magnitude\nof its electric field E is same. The magnitude of electric field E due to\na point charge is thus same on a sphere with the point charge at its\ncentre; in other words, it has a spherical symmetry. 1.7.1 Electric field due to a system of charges\nConsider a system of charges q , q , ..., q with position vectors r ,\n1 2 n 1\nr , ..., r relative to some origin O. Like the electric field at a point in\n2 n\nspace due to a single charge, electric field at a point in space due to the\nsystem of charges is defined to be the force experienced by a unit\ntest charge placed at that point, without disturbing the original\npositions of charges q , q , ..., q .

After all, for any system of charges, the measurable quantity\nis the force on a charge which can be directly determined using Coulomb’s\nlaw and the superposition principle [Eq. (1.5)]. Why then introduce this\nintermediate quantity called the electric field? For electrostatics, the concept of electric field is convenient, but not\nreally necessary. Electric field is an elegant way of characterising the\nelectrical environment of a system of charges. Electric field at a point in\nthe space around a system of charges tells you the force a unit positive\ntest charge would experience if placed at that point (without disturbing\nthe system). Electric field is a characteristic of the system of charges and\nis independent of the test charge that you place at a point to determine\nthe field. The term field in physics generally refers to a quantity that is\ndefined at every point in space and may vary from point to point. Electric\nfield is a vector field, since force is a vector quantity. The true physical significance of the concept of electric field, however,\nemerges only when we go beyond electrostatics and deal with time-\ndependent electromagnetic phenomena. Suppose we consider the force\nbetween two distant charges q , q in accelerated motion. Now the greatest\n1 2\nspeed with which a signal or information can go from one point to another\n16 is c, the speed of light. Thus, the effect of any motion of q on q cannot\n1 2\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\narise instantaneously. There will be some time delay between the effect\n(force on q ) and the cause (motion of q ). It is precisely here that the\n2 1\nnotion of electric field (strictly, electromagnetic field) is natural and very\nuseful.", "The field picture is this: the accelerated motion of charge q\n1\nproduces electromagnetic waves, which then propagate with the speed\nc, reach q and cause a force on q . The notion of field elegantly accounts\n2 2\nfor the time delay. Thus, even though electric and magnetic fields can be\ndetected only by their effects (forces) on charges, they are regarded as\nphysical entities, not merely mathematical constructs. They have an\nindependent dynamics of their own, i.e., they evolve according to laws\nof their own. They can also transport energy. Thus, a source of time-\ndependent electromagnetic fields, turned on for a short interval of time\nand then switched off, leaves behind propagating electromagnetic fields\ntransporting energy. The concept of field was first introduced by Faraday\nand is now among the central concepts in physics. Example 1.7 An electron falls through a distance of 1.5 cm in a\nuniform electric field of magnitude 2.0 × 104 N C–1 [Fig. 1.10(a)]. The\ndirection of the field is reversed keeping its magnitude unchanged\nand a proton falls through the same distance [Fig. 1.10(b)]. Compute\nthe time of fall in each case. Contrast the situation with that of ‘free\nfall under gravity’. FIGURE 1.10\nSolution In Fig. 1.10(a) the field is upward, so the negatively charged\nelectron experiences a downward force of magnitude eE where E is\nthe magnitude of the electric field. The acceleration of the electron is\na = eE/m\ne e\nwhere m is the mass of the electron. e\nStarting from rest, the time required by the electron to fall through a\n2h 2hm\ndistance h is given by t = = e\ne a eE\ne\nFor e = 1.6 × 10–19C, m = 9.11 × 10–31 kg,\ne\nE = 2.0 × 104 N C–1, h = 1.5 × 10–2 m,\nt = 2.9 × 10–9s\ne\nIn Fig. 1.10 (b), the field is downward, and the positively charged\nproton experiences a downward force of magnitude eE. The\nacceleration of the proton is\na = eE/m\np p\nwhere m is the mass of the proton; m = 1.67 × 10–27 kg. The time of\np p\nfall for the proton is\n17\nEXAMPLE\n1.7\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n18\n7.1\nELPMAXE\n8.1\nELPMAXE\n2h 2hm\nt = = p =1.3· 10–7s\np a eE\np\nThus, the heavier particle (proton) takes a greater time to fall through\nthe same distance. This is in basic contrast to the situation of ‘free\nfall under gravity’ where the time of fall is independent of the mass of\nthe body. Note that in this example we have ignored the acceleration\ndue to gravity in calculating the time of fall. To see if this is justified,\nlet us calculate the acceleration of the proton in the given electric\nfield:\neE\na =\np m\np\n(1.6 · 10 - 19 C)· (2.0· 104 N C - 1)\n=\n1.67 · 10 - 27 kg\n=1.9 · 1012 ms–2\nwhich is enormous compared to the value of g (9.8 m s–2), the\nacceleration due to gravity. The acceleration of the electron is even\ngreater. Thus, the effect of acceleration due to gravity can be ignored\nin this example.

C\n1.8 E F L\nLECTRIC IELD INES\nWe have studied electric field in the last section. It is a vector quantity\nand can be represented as we represent vectors. Let us try to represent E\ndue to a point charge pictorially. Let the point charge be placed at the\norigin. Draw vectors pointing along the direction of the\nelectric field with their lengths proportional to the strength\nof the field at each point. Since the magnitude of electric\nfield at a point decreases inversely as the square of the\ndistance of that point from the charge, the vector gets\nshorter as one goes away from the origin, always pointing\nradially outward. Figure 1.12 shows such a picture. In\nthis figure, each arrow indicates the electric field, i.e., the\nforce acting on a unit positive charge, placed at the tail of\nthat arrow. Connect the arrows pointing in one direction\nand the resulting figure represents a field line. We thus\nget many field lines, all pointing outwards from the point\ncharge. Have we lost the information about the strength\nor magnitude of the field now, because it was contained\nin the length of the arrow? No. Now the magnitude of the\nfield is represented by the density of field lines. E is strong\nnear the charge, so the density of field lines is more near\nthe charge and the lines are closer. Away from the charge, FIGURE 1.12 Field of a point charge. the field gets weaker and the density of field lines is less,\nresulting in well-separated lines. Another person may draw more lines. But the number of lines is not\n19\nimportant. In fact, an infinite number of lines can be drawn in any region. EXAMPLE\n1.8\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nIt is the relative density of lines in different regions which is\nimportant.", "We draw the figure on the plane of paper, i.e., in two-\ndimensions but we live in three-dimensions. So if one wishes\nto estimate the density of field lines, one has to consider the\nnumber of lines per unit cross-sectional area, perpendicular\nto the lines. Since the electric field decreases as the square of\nthe distance from a point charge and the area enclosing the\ncharge increases as the square of the distance, the number\nof field lines crossing the enclosing area remains constant,\nwhatever may be the distance of the area from the charge. We started by saying that the field lines carry information\nabout the direction of electric field at different points in space. FIGURE 1.13 Dependence of\nHaving drawn a certain set of field lines, the relative density\nelectric field strength on the\n(i.e., closeness) of the field lines at different points indicates\ndistance and its relation to the\nthe relative strength of electric field at those points. The field\nnumber of field lines. lines crowd where the field is strong and are spaced apart\nwhere it is weak. Figure 1.13 shows a set of field lines. We\ncan imagine two equal and small elements of area placed at points R and\nS normal to the field lines there. The number of field lines in our picture\ncutting the area elements is proportional to the magnitude of field at\nthese points. The picture shows that the field at R is stronger than at S. To understand the dependence of the field lines on the area, or rather\nthe solid angle subtended by an area element, let us try to relate the\narea with the solid angle, a generalisation of angle to three dimensions. Recall how a (plane) angle is defined in two-dimensions. Let a small\ntransverse line element Dl be placed at a distance r from a point O. Then\nthe angle subtended by Dl at O can be approximated as Dq = Dl/r. Likewise, in three-dimensions the solid angle* subtended by a small\nperpendicular plane area DS, at a distance r, can be written as\nDW = DS/r2. We know that in a given solid angle the number of radial\nfield lines is the same. In Fig. 1.13, for two points P and P at distances\n1 2\nr and r from the charge, the element of area subtending the solid angle\n1 2\nDW is r2DW at P and an element of area r2DW at P , respectively. The\n1 1 2 2\nnumber of lines (say n) cutting these area elements are the same. The\nnumber of field lines, cutting unit area element is therefore n/(r2DW) at\n1\nP and n/(r2DW) at P , respectively. Since n and DW are common, the\n1 2 2\nstrength of the field clearly has a 1/r2 dependence. The picture of field lines was invented by Faraday to develop an\nintuitive non-mathematical way of visualising electric fields around\ncharged configurations. Faraday called them lines of force. This term is\nsomewhat misleading, especially in case of magnetic fields. The more\nappropriate term is field lines (electric or magnetic) that we have\nadopted in this book.", "Electric field lines are thus a way of pictorially mapping the electric\nfield around a configuration of charges. An electric field line is, in general,\n* Solid angle is a measure of a cone. Consider the intersection of the given cone\nwith a sphere of radius R. The solid angle DW of the cone is defined to be equal\n20 to DS/R2, where DS is the area on the sphere cut out by the cone. Reprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\na curve drawn in such a way that the tangent to it at each\npoint is in the direction of the net field at that point. An\narrow on the curve is obviously necessary to specify the\ndirection of electric field from the two possible directions\nindicated by a tangent to the curve. A field line is a space\ncurve, i.e., a curve in three dimensions. Figure 1.14 shows the field lines around some simple\ncharge configurations. As mentioned earlier, the field lines\nare in 3-dimensional space, though the figure shows them\nonly in a plane. The field lines of a single positive charge\nare radially outward while those of a single negative\ncharge are radially inward. The field lines around a system\nof two positive charges (q, q) give a vivid pictorial\ndescription of their mutual repulsion, while those around\nthe configuration of two equal and opposite charges\n(q, –q), a dipole, show clearly the mutual attraction\nbetween the charges. The field lines follow some important\ngeneral properties:\n(i) Field lines start from positive charges and end at\nnegative charges. If there is a single charge, they may\nstart or end at infinity. (ii) In a charge-free region, electric field lines can be taken\nto be continuous curves without any breaks. (iii) Two field lines can never cross each other. (If they did,\nthe field at the point of intersection will not have a\nunique direction, which is absurd.)\n(iv) Electrostatic field lines do not form any closed loops. This follows from the conservative nature of electric\nfield (Chapter 2). 1.9 E F\nLECTRIC LUX\nConsider flow of a liquid with velocity v, through a small\nflat surface dS, in a direction normal to the surface. The\nrate of flow of liquid is given by the volume crossing the\narea per unit time v dS and represents the flux of liquid\nflowing across the plane. If the normal to the surface is\nnot parallel to the direction of flow of liquid, i.e., to v, but\nmakes an angle q with it, the projected area in a plane\nperpendicular to v is d dS cos q. Therefore, the flux going\nout of the surface dS is v.nˆ dS. For the case of the electric\nfield, we define an analogous quantity and call it electric\nflux. We should, however, note that there is no flow of a\nphysically observable quantity unlike the case of\nliquid flow. In the picture of electric field lines described above,\nFIGURE 1.14 Field lines due to\nwe saw that the number of field lines crossing a unit area,\nsome simple charge configurations. placed normal to the field at a point is a measure of the\n21\nstrength of electric field at that point.", "This means that if\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nwe place a small planar element of area DS\nnormal to E at a point, the number of field lines\ncrossing it is proportional* to E DS. Now\nsuppose we tilt the area element by angle q. Clearly, the number of field lines crossing the\narea element will be smaller. The projection of\nthe area element normal to E is DS cosq. Thus,\nthe number of field lines crossing DS is\nproportional to E DS cosq. When q = 90°, field\nlines will be parallel to DS and will not cross it\nat all (Fig. 1.15). The orientation of area element and not\nmerely its magnitude is important in many\ncontexts. For example, in a stream, the amount\nof water flowing through a ring will naturally\ndepend on how you hold the ring. If you hold\nit normal to the flow, maximum water will flow\nFIGURE 1.15 Dependence of flux on the\nthrough it than if you hold it with some other\ninclination q between E and nˆ . orientation. This shows that an area element\nshould be treated as a vector. It has a\nmagnitude and also a direction. How to specify the direction of a planar\narea? Clearly, the normal to the plane specifies the orientation of the\nplane. Thus the direction of a planar area vector is along its normal. How to associate a vector to the area of a curved surface? We imagine\ndividing the surface into a large number of very small area elements. Each small area element may be treated as planar and a vector associated\nwith it, as explained before. Notice one ambiguity here. The direction of an area element is along\nits normal. But a normal can point in two directions. Which direction do\nwe choose as the direction of the vector associated with the area element? This problem is resolved by some convention appropriate to the given\ncontext. For the case of a closed surface, this convention is very simple. The vector associated with every area element of a closed surface is taken\nto be in the direction of the outward normal. This is the convention used\nin Fig. 1.16. Thus, the area element vector DS at a point on a closed\nsurface equals DS nˆ where DS is the magnitude of the area element and\nnˆ is a unit vector in the direction of outward normal at that point. We now come to the definition of electric flux. Electric flux Df through\nan area element DS is defined by\nDf = E.DS = E DS cosq (1.11)\nwhich, as seen before, is proportional to the number of field lines cutting\nthe area element.

The line connecting the two charges defines\na direction in space. By convention, the direction from –q to q is said to\nbe the direction of the dipole. The mid-point of locations of –q and q is\ncalled the centre of the dipole. The total charge of the electric dipole is obviously zero. This does not\nmean that the field of the electric dipole is zero. Since the charge q and\n–q are separated by some distance, the electric fields due to them, when\nadded, do not exactly cancel out. However, at distances much larger than\nthe separation of the two charges forming a dipole (r >> 2a), the fields\ndue to q and –q nearly cancel out. The electric field due to a dipole\ntherefore falls off, at large distance, faster than like 1/r2 (the dependence\non r of the field due to a single charge q). These qualitative ideas are\nborne out by the explicit calculation as follows:\n1.10.1 The field of an electric dipole\nThe electric field of the pair of charges (–q and q) at any point in space\ncan be found out from Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle.

The net force on\nthe dipole is zero, since E is uniform. However, the charges are\nseparated, so the forces act at different points, resulting in a torque\non the dipole. When the net force is zero, the torque (couple) is\nindependent of the origin. Its magnitude equals the magnitude of FIGURE 1.19 Dipole in a\neach force multiplied by the arm of the couple (perpendicular uniform electric field. distance between the two antiparallel forces). Magnitude of torque = q E × 2 a sinq\n= 2 q a E sinq\nIts direction is normal to the plane of the paper, coming out of it. The magnitude of p × E is also p E sinq and its direction\nis normal to the paper, coming out of it. Thus,\nttttt = p × E (1.22)\nThis torque will tend to align the dipole with the field\nE. When p is aligned with E, the torque is zero. What happens if the field is not uniform? In that case,\nthe net force will evidently be non-zero. In addition there\nwill, in general, be a torque on the system as before. The\ngeneral case is involved, so let us consider the simpler\nsituations when p is parallel to E or antiparallel to E. In\neither case, the net torque is zero, but there is a net force\non the dipole if E is not uniform. Figure 1.20 is self-explanatory. It is easily seen that\nwhen p is parallel to E, the dipole has a net force in the\ndirection of increasing field. When p is antiparallel to E,\nthe net force on the dipole is in the direction of decreasing\nfield. In general, the force depends on the orientation of p\nwith respect to E. This brings us to a common observation in frictional\nelectricity. A comb run through dry hair attracts pieces of\nFIGURE 1.20 Electric force on a\npaper. The comb, as we know, acquires charge through dipole: (a) E parallel to p, (b) E\nfriction. But the paper is not charged. What then explains antiparallel to p. the attractive force? Taking the clue from the preceding\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\ndiscussion, the charged comb ‘polarises’ the piece of paper, i.e., induces\na net dipole moment in the direction of field. Further, the electric field\ndue to the comb is not uniform. This non-uniformity of the field makes a\ndipole to experience a net force on it. In this situation, it is easily seen\nthat the paper should move in the direction of the comb! 1.12 C C D\nONTINUOUS HARGE ISTRIBUTION\nWe have so far dealt with charge configurations involving discrete charges\nq , q , ..., q . One reason why we restricted to discrete charges is that the\n1 2 n\nmathematical treatment is simpler and does not involve calculus. For\nmany purposes, however, it is impractical to work in terms of discrete\ncharges and we need to work with continuous charge distributions. For\nexample, on the surface of a charged conductor, it is impractical to specify\nthe charge distribution in terms of the locations of the microscopic charged\nconstituents.", "It is more feasible to consider an area element DS (Fig. 1.21)\non the surface of the conductor (which is very small on the macroscopic\nscale but big enough to include a very large number of electrons) and\nspecify the charge DQ on that element. We then define a surface charge\ndensity s at the area element by\nD Q\ns =\n(1.23)\nD S\nWe can do this at different points on the conductor and thus arrive at\na continuous function s, called the surface charge density. The surface\ncharge density s so defined ignores the quantisation of charge and the\ndiscontinuity in charge distribution at the microscopic level*. s represents\nmacroscopic surface charge density, which in a sense, is a smoothed out\naverage of the microscopic charge density over an area element DS which,\nas said before, is large microscopically but small macroscopically. The\nunits for s are C/m2. FIGURE 1.21 Similar considerations apply for a line charge distribution and a volume\nDefinition of linear, charge distribution.

We\nregard it as a continuous fluid and ignore its discrete molecular\nconstitution. The field due to a continuous charge distribution can be obtained in\nmuch the same way as for a system of discrete charges, Eq. (1.10). Suppose\na continuous charge distribution in space has a charge density r. Choose\nany convenient origin O and let the position vector of any point in the\ncharge distribution be r. The charge density r may vary from point to\npoint, i.e., it is a function of r. Divide the charge distribution into small\nvolume elements of size DV. The charge in a volume element DV is rDV. Now, consider any general point P (inside or outside the distribution)\nwith position vector R (Fig. 1.21).", "Electric field due to the charge rDV is\ngiven by Coulomb’s law:\n1 r D V\nD E= rˆ'\n4p e r'2 (1.26)\n0\nwhere r¢ is the distance between the charge element and P, and rˆ¢ is a\nunit vector in the direction from the charge element to P.

In a strict\nmathematical method, we should let DVfi0 and the sum then becomes\nan integral; but we omit that discussion here, for simplicity. In short,\nusing Coulomb’s law and the superposition principle, electric field can\nbe determined for any charge distribution, discrete or continuous or part\ndiscrete and part continuous. 1.13 G ’ L\nAUSS S AW\nAs a simple application of the notion of electric flux, let us consider the\ntotal flux through a sphere of radius r, which encloses a point charge q\nat its centre. Divide the sphere into small area elements, as shown in\nFig. 1.22. The flux through an area element DS is\nq\nD f= EDi =S 4p e r2 rˆiD S (1.28)\n0\nwhere we have used Coulomb’s law for the electric field due to a single\ncharge q. The unit vector rˆ is along the radius vector from the centre to\nthe area element. Now, since the normal to a sphere at every point is\nalong the radius vector at that point, the area element DS and rˆ have\nthe same direction. Therefore,\nFIGURE 1.22 Flux\nq\nD f= 4p e r2 D S (1.29) through a sphere\n0 enclosing a point\nsince the magnitude of a unit vector is 1. charge q at its centre.

We state Gauss’s law without proof:\nElectric flux through a closed surface S\n= q/e (1.31)\n0\nq = total charge enclosed by S. The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface is\nzero if no charge is enclosed by the surface. We can see that explicitly in\nthe simple situation of Fig. 1.23. Here the electric field is uniform and we are considering a closed\ncylindrical surface, with its axis parallel to the uniform field E. The total\nflux f through the surface is f = f + f + f, where f and f represent\n1 2 3 1 2\nthe flux through the surfaces 1 and 2 (of circular cross-section) of the\ncylinder and f is the flux through the curved cylindrical part of the\n3\nclosed surface. Now the normal to the surface 3 at every point is\nperpendicular to E, so by definition of flux, f = 0.", "Further, the outward\n3\nnormal to 2 is along E while the outward normal to 1 is opposite to E. Therefore,\nf = –E S , f = +E S\n1 1 2 2\nS = S = S\n1 2\nwhere S is the area of circular cross-section. Thus, the total flux is zero,\nas expected by Gauss’s law. Thus, whenever you find that the net electric\nflux through a closed surface is zero, we conclude that the total charge\ncontained in the closed surface is zero. The great significance of Gauss’s law Eq. (1.31), is that it is true in\ngeneral, and not only for the simple cases we have considered above. Let\nus note some important points regarding this law:\n(i) Gauss’s law is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape\nor size. (ii) The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, Eq. (1.31), includes the\nsum of all charges enclosed by the surface. The charges may be located\nanywhere inside the surface. (iii) In the situation when the surface is so chosen that there are some\ncharges inside and some outside, the electric field [whose flux appears\non the left side of Eq. (1.31)] is due to all the charges, both inside and\noutside S. The term q on the right side of Gauss’s law, however,\n30\nrepresents only the total charge inside S. Reprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n31\nEXAMPLE\n1.10\n(iv) The surface that we choose for the application of Gauss’s law is called\nthe Gaussian surface. You may choose any Gaussian surface and\napply Gauss’s law. However, take care not to let the Gaussian surface\npass through any discrete charge. This is because electric field due\nto a system of discrete charges is not well defined at the location of\nany charge. (As you go close to the charge, the field grows without\nany bound.) However, the Gaussian surface can pass through a\ncontinuous charge distribution. (v) Gauss’s law is often useful towards a much easier calculation of the\nelectrostatic field when the system has some symmetry. This is\nfacilitated by the choice of a suitable Gaussian surface. (vi) Finally, Gauss’s law is based on the inverse square dependence on\ndistance contained in the Coulomb’s law. Any violation of Gauss’s\nlaw will indicate departure from the inverse square law.

The points P, P¢, P¢¢ so\nobtained are completely equivalent with\nrespect to the charged wire. This implies that\nthe electric field must have the same magnitude\nat these points. The direction of electric field at\nevery point must be radial (outward if l > 0,\ninward if l < 0).

Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 2prl = ll/e\n0\nl\ni.e.,E = 2p e r\n0\nVectorially, E at any point is given by\nl\nE = 2p e r nˆ (1.32)\n0\nwhere nˆ is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point. E is directed outward if l is positive and inward if l is\nnegative. Note that when we write a vector A as a scalar multiplied by a unit\nvector, i.e., as A = A aˆ, the scalar A is an algebraic number. It can be\nnegative or positive. The direction of A will be the same as that of the unit\nvector aˆ if A > 0 and opposite to aˆ if A < 0. When we want to restrict to\nnon-negative values, we use the symbol A and call it the modulus of A. Thus, A ‡ 0. Also note that though only the charge enclosed by the surface (ll)\nwas included above, the electric field E is due to the charge on the entire\nwire. Further, the assumption that the wire is infinitely long is crucial. Without this assumption, we cannot take E to be normal to the curved\npart of the cylindrical Gaussian surface. However, Eq. (1.32) is\napproximately true for electric field around the central portions of a long\nwire, where the end effects may be ignored. 1.14.2 Field due to a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet\nLet s be the uniform surface charge density of an infinite plane sheet\n(Fig. 1.27). We take the x-axis normal to the given plane. By symmetry,\nthe electric field will not depend on y and z coordinates and its direction\nat every point must be parallel to the x-direction. We can take the Gaussian surface to be a\nrectangular parallelepiped of cross-sectional area\nA, as shown.", "(A cylindrical surface will also do.) As\nseen from the figure, only the two faces 1 and 2 will\ncontribute to the flux; electric field lines are parallel\nto the other faces and they, therefore, do not\ncontribute to the total flux. The unit vector normal to surface 1 is in –x\ndirection while the unit vector normal to surface 2\nis in the +x direction. Therefore, flux E.DS through\nboth the surfaces are equal and add up. Therefore\nFIGURE 1.27 Gaussian surface for a\nthe net flux through the Gaussian surface is 2 EA. uniformly charged infinite plane sheet. The charge enclosed by the closed surface is sA. 34 Therefore by Gauss’s law,\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n2 EA = sA/e\n0\nor, E = s/2e\n0\nVectorically,\ns\nE = 2e nˆ (1.33)\n0\nwhere nˆ is a unit vector normal to the plane and going away from it. E is directed away from the plate if s is positive and toward the plate\nif s is negative. Note that the above application of the Gauss’ law has\nbrought out an additional fact: E is independent of x also. For a finite large planar sheet, Eq. (1.33) is approximately true in the\nmiddle regions of the planar sheet, away from the ends. 1.14.3 Field due to a uniformly charged thin spherical shell\nLet s be the uniform surface charge density of a thin spherical shell of\nradius R (Fig. 1.28). The situation has obvious spherical symmetry. The\nfield at any point P, outside or inside, can depend only on r (the radial\ndistance from the centre of the shell to the point) and must be radial (i.e.,\nalong the radius vector). (i) Field outside the shell: Consider a point P outside the\nshell with radius vector r. To calculate E at P, we take the\nGaussian surface to be a sphere of radius r and with centre\nO, passing through P. All points on this sphere are equivalent\nrelative to the given charged configuration. (That is what we\nmean by spherical symmetry.) The electric field at each point\nof the Gaussian surface, therefore, has the same magnitude\nE and is along the radius vector at each point. Thus, E and\nDS at every point are parallel and the flux through each\nelement is E DS. Summing over all DS, the flux through the\nGaussian surface is E × 4 p r2. The charge enclosed is\ns × 4 p R2. By Gauss’s law\ns\nE × 4 p r2 = e 4 p R2\n0\ns R2 q\nOr, E = =\ne r2 4pe r2\n0 0\nwhere q = 4 p R2 s is the total charge on the spherical shell.

The electric field is directed outward if q > 0 and inward if\nq < 0. This, however, is exactly the field produced by a charge\nq placed at the centre O. Thus for points outside the shell, the field due\nto a uniformly charged shell is as if the entire charge of the shell is\nconcentrated at its centre. (ii) Field inside the shell: In Fig. 1.28(b), the point P is inside the\nshell. The Gaussian surface is again a sphere through P centred at O.", "35\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n36\n21.1\nELPMAXE\nThe flux through the Gaussian surface, calculated as before, is\nE × 4 p r2. However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no\ncharge. Gauss’s law then gives\nE × 4 p r2 = 0\ni.e., E = 0 (r < R ) (1.35)\nthat is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points\ninside the shell*. This important result is a direct consequence of Gauss’s\nlaw which follows from Coulomb’s law. The experimental verification of\nthis result confirms the 1/r2 dependence in Coulomb’s law. Example 1.12 An early model for an atom considered it to have a\npositively charged point nucleus of charge Ze, surrounded by a\nuniform density of negative charge up to a radius R. The atom as a\nwhole is neutral. For this model, what is the electric field at a distance\nr from the nucleus? FIGURE 1.29\nSolution The charge distribution for this model of the atom is as\nshown in Fig. 1.29. The total negative charge in the uniform spherical\ncharge distribution of radius R must be –Z e, since the atom (nucleus\nof charge Z e + negative charge) is neutral. This immediately gives us\nthe negative charge density r, since we must have\n4p R3\nr =0–Ze\n3\n3Ze\nr =-\nor 4p R3\nTo find the electric field E(r) at a point P which is a distance r away\nfrom the nucleus, we use Gauss’s law. Because of the spherical\nsymmetry of the charge distribution, the magnitude of the electric\nfield E(r) depends only on the radial distance, no matter what the\ndirection of r. Its direction is along (or opposite to) the radius vector r\nfrom the origin to the point P. The obvious Gaussian surface is a\nspherical surface centred at the nucleus. We consider two situations,\nnamely, r < R and r > R. (i) r < R : The electric flux f enclosed by the spherical surface is\nf = E (r) × 4 p r2\n* Compare this with a uniform mass shell discussed in Section 7.5 of Class XI\nTextbook of Physics. Reprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n37\nEXAMPLE\n1.12\nwhere E (r) is the magnitude of the electric field at r. This is because\nthe field at any point on the spherical Gaussian surface has the\nsame direction as the normal to the surface there, and has the same\nmagnitude at all points on the surface. The charge q enclosed by the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear\ncharge and the negative charge within the sphere of radius r,\n4p r3\ni.e., q = Ze + r\n3\nSubstituting for the charge density r obtained earlier, we have\nr3\nq = Ze- Ze\nR3\nGauss’s law then gives,\nZ e 1 r\nE(r)= - ; r < R\n4 p e r2 R3\n0\nThe electric field is directed radially outward. (ii) r > R: In this case, the total charge enclosed by the Gaussian\nspherical surface is zero since the atom is neutral. Thus, from Gauss’s\nlaw,\nE (r) × 4 p r2 = 0 or E (r) = 0; r > R\nAt r = R, both cases give the same result: E = 0. SUMMARY\n1. Electric and magnetic forces determine the properties of atoms,\nmolecules and bulk matter. 2.", "From simple experiments on frictional electricity, one can infer that\nthere are two types of charges in nature; and that like charges repel\nand unlike charges attract. By convention, the charge on a glass rod\nrubbed with silk is positive; that on a plastic rod rubbed with fur is\nthen negative. 3. Conductors allow movement of electric charge through them,\ninsulators do not. In metals, the mobile charges are electrons; in\nelectrolytes both positive and negative ions are mobile. 4. Electric charge has three basic properties: quantisation, additivity\nand conservation. Quantisation of electric charge means that total charge (q) of a body\nis always an integral multiple of a basic quantum of charge (e) i.e.,\nq = n e, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, ±3, .... Proton and electron have charges\n+e, –e, respectively. For macroscopic charges for which n is a very large\nnumber, quantisation of charge can be ignored. Additivity of electric charges means that the total charge of a system\nis the algebraic sum (i.e., the sum taking into account proper signs)\nof all individual charges in the system. Conservation of electric charges means that the total charge of an\nisolated system remains unchanged with time. This means that when\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nbodies are charged through friction, there is a transfer of electric charge\nfrom one body to another, but no creation or destruction\nof charge. 5. Coulomb’s Law: The mutual electrostatic force between two point\ncharges q and q is proportional to the product q q and inversely\n1 2 1 2\nproportional to the square of the distance r separating them. 21\nMathematically,\nk (qq )\nF = force on q due to q = 1 2 rˆ\n21 2 1 r2 21\n21\n1\nwhere rˆ is a unit vector in the direction from q to q and k =\n21 1 2 4p e\n0\nis the constant of proportionality. In SI units, the unit of charge is coulomb. The experimental value of\nthe constant e is\n0\ne = 8.854 × 10–12 C2 N–1 m–2\n0\nThe approximate value of k is\nk = 9 × 109 N m2 C–2\n6. The ratio of electric force and gravitational force between a proton\nand an electron is\nk e2\n@ 2.4· 1039\nG m m\ne p\n7. Superposition Principle: The principle is based on the property that the\nforces with which two charges attract or repel each other are not\naffected by the presence of a third (or more) additional charge(s). For\nan assembly of charges q , q , q , ..., the force on any charge, say q , is\n1 2 3 1\nthe vector sum of the force on q due to q , the force on q due to q ,\n1 2 1 3\nand so on. For each pair, the force is given by the Coulomb’s law for\ntwo charges stated earlier. 8. The electric field E at a point due to a charge configuration is the\nforce on a small positive test charge q placed at the point divided by\nthe magnitude of the charge. Electric field due to a point charge q has\na magnitude |q|/4per2; it is radially outwards from q, if q is positive,\n0\nand radially inwards if q is negative. Like Coulomb force, electric field\nalso satisfies superposition principle. 9.", "An electric field line is a curve drawn in such a way that the tangent\nat each point on the curve gives the direction of electric field at that\npoint. The relative closeness of field lines indicates the relative strength\nof electric field at different points; they crowd near each other in regions\nof strong electric field and are far apart where the electric field is\nweak. In regions of constant electric field, the field lines are uniformly\nspaced parallel straight lines. 10. Some of the important properties of field lines are: (i) Field lines are\ncontinuous curves without any breaks. (ii) Two field lines cannot cross\neach other. (iii) Electrostatic field lines start at positive charges and\nend at negative charges —they cannot form closed loops. 11. An electric dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges q and –q\nseparated by some distance 2a. Its dipole moment vector p has\nmagnitude 2qa and is in the direction of the dipole axis from –q to q. 38\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\n12.

In a uniform electric field E, a dipole experiences a torque t given by\nt = p × E\nbut experiences no net force. 14. The flux Df of electric field E through a small area element DS is\ngiven by\nDf = E.DS\nThe vector area element DS is\nDS = DS nˆ\nwhere DS is the magnitude of the area element and nˆ is normal to the\narea element, which can be considered planar for sufficiently small DS. For an area element of a closed surface, nˆ is taken to be the direction\nof outward normal, by convention. 15. Gauss’s law: The flux of electric field through any closed surface S is\n1/e times the total charge enclosed by S. The law is especially useful\n0\nin determining electric field E, when the source distribution has simple\nsymmetry:\n(i) Thin infinitely long straight wire of uniform linear charge density l\nl\nE = nˆ\n2p e r\n0\nwhere r is the perpendicular distance of the point from the wire and\nnˆ is the radial unit vector in the plane normal to the wire passing\nthrough the point.

You might wonder why the protons, all carrying positive charges,\nare compactly residing inside the nucleus. Why do they not fly away? You will learn that there is a third kind of a fundamental force,\ncalled the strong force which holds them together. The range of\ndistance where this force is effective is, however, very small ~10-14\nm. This is precisely the size of the nucleus. Also the electrons are\nnot allowed to sit on top of the protons, i.e. inside the nucleus,\ndue to the laws of quantum mechanics. This gives the atoms their\nstructure as they exist in nature. 2. Coulomb force and gravitational force follow the same inverse-square\nlaw. But gravitational force has only one sign (always attractive), while\n40\nReprint 2025-26\nElectric Charges\nand Fields\nCoulomb force can be of both signs (attractive and repulsive), allowing\npossibility of cancellation of electric forces. This is how gravity, despite\nbeing a much weaker force, can be a dominating and more pervasive\nforce in nature. 3. The constant of proportionality k in Coulomb’s law is a matter of\nchoice if the unit of charge is to be defined using Coulomb’s law. In SI\nunits, however, what is defined is the unit of current (A) via its magnetic\neffect (Ampere’s law) and the unit of charge (coulomb) is simply defined\nby (1C = 1 A s). In this case, the value of k is no longer arbitrary; it is\napproximately 9 × 109 N m2 C–2. 4. The rather large value of k, i.e., the large size of the unit of charge\n(1C) from the point of view of electric effects arises because (as\nmentioned in point 3 already) the unit of charge is defined in terms of\nmagnetic forces (forces on current–carrying wires) which are generally\nmuch weaker than the electric forces. Thus while 1 ampere is a unit\nof reasonable size for magnetic effects, 1 C = 1 A s, is too big a unit for\nelectric effects. 5. The additive property of charge is not an ‘obvious’ property. It is related\nto the fact that electric charge has no direction associated with it;\ncharge is a scalar. 6. Charge is not only a scalar (or invariant) under rotation; it is also\ninvariant for frames of reference in relative motion. This is not always\ntrue for every scalar. For example, kinetic energy is a scalar under\nrotation, but is not invariant for frames of reference in relative\nmotion. 7. Conservation of total charge of an isolated system is a property\nindependent of the scalar nature of charge noted in point 6.", "Conservation refers to invariance in time in a given frame of reference. A quantity may be scalar but not conserved (like kinetic energy in an\ninelastic collision). On the other hand, one can have conserved vector\nquantity (e.g., angular momentum of an isolated system). 8. Quantisation of electric charge is a basic (unexplained) law of nature;\ninterestingly, there is no analogous law on quantisation of mass. 9. Superposition principle should not be regarded as ‘obvious’, or\nequated with the law of addition of vectors. It says two things:\nforce on one charge due to another charge is unaffected by the\npresence of other charges, and there are no additional three-body,\nfour-body, etc., forces which arise only when there are more than\ntwo charges. 10. The electric field due to a discrete charge configuration is not defined\nat the locations of the discrete charges. For continuous volume\ncharge distribution, it is defined at any point in the distribution. For a surface charge distribution, electric field is discontinuous\nacross the surface. 11. The electric field due to a charge configuration with total charge zero\nis not zero; but for distances large compared to the size of\nthe configuration, its field falls off faster than 1/r2, typical of field\ndue to a single charge. An electric dipole is the simplest example of\nthis fact. 41\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nEXERCISES\n1.1 What is the force between two small charged spheres having\ncharges of 2 × 10–7C and 3 × 10–7C placed 30 cm apart in air? 1.2 The electrostatic force on a small sphere of charge 0.4 mC due to\nanother small sphere of charge –0.8 mC in air is 0.2 N.
