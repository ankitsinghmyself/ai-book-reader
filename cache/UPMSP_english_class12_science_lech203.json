There are two systems of nomenclature of aldehydes and ketones. (a) Common names\nAldehydes and ketones are often called by their common names\ninstead of IUPAC names. The common names of most aldehydes are\nderived from the common names of the corresponding carboxylic\nacids [Section 8.6.1] by replacing the ending –ic of acid with aldehyde. At the same time, the names reflect the Latin or Greek term for the\noriginal source of the acid or aldehyde. The location of the substituent\nin the carbon chain is indicated by Greek letters a, b, g, d, etc. The\na-carbon being the one directly linked to the aldehyde group, b-\ncarbon the next, and so on. For example\nChemistry 228\nReprint 2025-26\nThe common names of ketones are derived by naming two alkyl\nor aryl groups bonded to the carbonyl group. The locations of\nsubstituents are indicated by Greek letters, a a¢, b b¢ and so on\nbeginning with the carbon atoms next to the carbonyl group,\nindicated as aa¢. Some ketones have historical common names,\nthe simplest dimethyl ketone is called acetone. Alkyl phenyl\nketones are usually named by adding the name of acyl group as\nprefix to the word phenone. For example\n(b) IUPAC names\nThe IUPAC names of open chain aliphatic aldehydes and ketones\nare derived from the names of the corresponding alkanes by\nreplacing the ending –e with –al and –one respectively. In case of\naldehydes the longest carbon chain is numbered starting from the\ncarbon of the aldehyde group while in case of ketones the\nnumbering begins from the end nearer to the carbonyl group. The\nsubstituents are prefixed in alphabetical order along with numerals\nindicating their positions in the carbon chain. The same applies to\ncyclic ketones, where the carbonyl carbon is numbered one. When\nthe aldehyde group is attached to a ring, the suffix carbaldehyde\nis added after the full name of the cycloalkane. The numbering of\nthe ring carbon atoms start from the carbon atom attached to the\naldehyde group. The name of the simplest aromatic aldehyde\ncarrying the aldehyde group on a benzene ring is\nbenzenecarbaldehyde. However, the common name benzaldehyde\nis also accepted by IUPAC. Other aromatic aldehydes are hence\nnamed as substituted benzaldehydes. 229 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nThe common and IUPAC names of some aldehydes and ketones are\ngiven in Table 8.1.", "Table 8.1: Common and IUPAC Names of Some Aldehydes and Ketones\nStructure Common name IUPAC name\nAldehydes\nHCHO Formaldehyde Methanal\nCH CHO Acetaldehyde Ethanal\n3\n(CH ) CHCHO Isobutyraldehyde 2-Methylpropanal\n32\ng-Methylcyclohexanecarbaldehyde 3-Methylcyclohexanecarbaldehyde\nCH CH(OCH )CHO a-Methoxypropionaldehyde 2-Methoxypropanal\n3 3\nCH CH CH CH CHO Valeraldehyde Pentanal\n3 2 2 2\nCH =CHCHO Acrolein Prop-2-enal\n2\nPhthaldehyde Benzene-1,2-dicarbaldehyde\n3-Bromobenzenecarbaldehyde\nor\nm-Bromobenzaldehyde 3-Bromobenzaldehyde\nKetones\nCH COCH CH CH Methyl n-propyl ketone Pentan-2-one\n3 2 2 3\n(CH ) CHCOCH(CH ) Diisopropyl ketone 2,4-Dimethylpentan-3-one\n32 3 2\na-Methylcyclohexanone 2-Methylcyclohexanone\n(CH ) C=CHCOCH Mesityl oxide 4-Methylpent-3-en-2-one\n3 2 3\nChemistry 230\nReprint 2025-26\n8.1.2 Structure of The carbonyl carbon atom is sp2-hybridised and forms three sigma (s)\nthe bonds. The fourth valence electron of carbon remains in its p-orbital\nCarbonyl and forms a p-bond with oxygen by overlap with p-orbital of an oxygen. Group In addition, the oxygen atom also has two non bonding electron pairs. Thus, the carbonyl carbon and the three atoms attached to it lie in the\nsame plane and the p-electron cloud is above and below this plane. The\nbond angles are approximately 120° as expected of a trigonal coplanar\nstructure (Figure 8.1). p\nFig.8.1 Orbital diagram for the formation of carbonyl group\nThe carbon-oxygen double bond is polarised due to higher\nelectronegativity of oxygen relative to carbon. Hence, the carbonyl\ncarbon is an electrophilic (Lewis acid), and carbonyl\noxygen, a nucleophilic (Lewis base) centre. Carbonyl\ncompounds have substantial dipole moments and are\npolar than ethers. The high polarity of the carbonyl group\nis explained on the basis of resonance involving a neutral\n(A) and a dipolar (B) structures as shown.

Alternatively, nitriles are selectively reduced by\ndiisobutylaluminium hydride, (DIBAL-H) to imines followed by\nhydrolysis to aldehydes:\nSimilarly, esters are also reduced to aldehydes with DIBAL-H. 3. From hydrocarbons\nAromatic aldehydes (benzaldehyde and its derivatives) are prepared\nfrom aromatic hydrocarbons by the following methods:\n(i) By oxidation of methylbenzene\nStrong oxidising agents oxidise toluene and its derivatives to\nbenzoic acids. However, it is possible to stop the oxidation at\nthe aldehyde stage with suitable reagents that convert the methyl\ngroup to an intermediate that is difficult to oxidise further. The\nfollowing methods are used for this purpose. (a) Use of chromyl chloride (CrO Cl ): Chromyl chloride oxidises\n2 2\nmethyl group to a chromium complex, which on hydrolysis\ngives corresponding benzaldehyde. Chemistry 232\nReprint 2025-26\nThis reaction is called Etard reaction. (b) Use of chromic oxide (CrO ): Toluene or substituted toluene\n3\nis converted to benzylidene diacetate on treating with chromic\noxide in acetic anhydride.

The boiling points of aldehydes and ketones are higher than\nhydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular masses. It is due to\nweak molecular association in aldehydes and ketones arising out of the\ndipole-dipole interactions. Also, their boiling points are lower than those\nof alcohols of similar molecular masses due to absence of intermolecular\nhydrogen bonding.

However, the solubility of aldehydes and ketones decreases rapidly\non increasing the length of alkyl chain. All aldehydes and ketones are\nfairly soluble in organic solvents like benzene, ether, methanol,\nchloroform, etc. The lower aldehydes have sharp pungent odours. As\nthe size of the molecule increases, the odour becomes less pungent\nand more fragrant. In fact, many naturally occurring aldehydes and\nketones are used in the blending of perfumes and flavouring agents.

RRRRReeeeeaaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss\n1. Nucleophilic addition reactions\nContrary to electrophilic addition reactions observed in alkenes, the\naldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions. (i) Mechanism of nucleophilic addition reactions\nA nucleophile attacks the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar\ncarbonyl group from a direction approximately perpendicular\nto the plane of sp2 hybridised orbitals of carbonyl carbon (Fig. 8.2). The hybridisation of carbon changes from sp2 to sp3 in\nthis process, and a tetrahedral alkoxide intermediate is\nproduced. This intermediate captures a proton from the\nreaction medium to give\nthe electrically neutral\nproduct. The net result is\naddition of Nu– and H+\nacross the carbon oxygen\ndouble bond as shown in\nFig. 8.2. Fig.8.2: Nucleophilic attack on carbonyl carbon\n(ii) Reactivity\nAldehydes are generally more reactive than ketones in\nnucleophilic addition reactions due to steric and electronic\nreasons. Sterically, the presence of two relatively large\nsubstituents in ketones hinders the approach of nucleophile to\ncarbonyl carbon than in aldehydes having only one such\nsubstituent. Electronically, aldehydes are more reactive than\nketones because two alkyl groups reduce the electrophilicity of\nthe carbonyl carbon more effectively than in former. EEEEExxxxxaaaaammmmmpppppllllleeeee 88888.....33333 Would you expect benzaldehyde to be more reactive or less reactive in\nnucleophilic addition reactions than propanal? Explain your answer. SSSSSooooollllluuuuutttttiiiiiooooonnnnn The carbon atom of the carbonyl group of benzaldehyde is less\nelectrophilic than carbon atom of the carbonyl group present in\npropanal. The polarity of the carbonyl\ngroup is reduced in benzaldehyde due\nto resonance as shown below and\nhence it is less reactive than propanal.", "Chemistry 236\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Some important examples of nucleophilic addition and\nnucleophilic addition-elimination reactions:\n(a) Addition of hydrogen cyanide (HCN): Aldehydes\nand ketones react with hydrogen cyanide (HCN)\nto yield cyanohydrins. This reaction occurs very\nslowly with pure HCN. Therefore, it is catalysed\nby a base and the generated cyanide ion (CN-)\nbeing a stronger nucleophile readily adds to\ncarbonyl compounds to yield corresponding\ncyanohydrin. Cyanohydrins are useful synthetic\nintermediates. (b) Addition of sodium hydrogensulphite: Sodium\nhydrogensulphite adds to aldehydes and\nketones to form the addition products. The position of\nthe equilibrium\nlies largely to\nthe right hand\nside for most\naldehydes and to\nthe left for most\nketones due to steric reasons. The hydrogensulphite addition\ncompound is water soluble and can be converted back to the\noriginal carbonyl compound by treating it with dilute mineral\nacid or alkali. Therefore, these are useful for separation and\npurification of aldehydes. (c) Addition of Grignard reagents: (refer Unit 7, Class XII). (d) Addition of alcohols: Aldehydes react with one equivalent of\nmonohydric alcohol in the presence of dry hydrogen chloride\nto yield alkoxyalcohol intermediate, known as hemiacetals,\nwhich further react with one more molecule of alcohol to\ngive a gem-dialkoxy\ncompound known as\nacetal as shown in the\nreaction. Ketones react with\nethylene glycol under\nsimilar conditions to form\ncyclic products known as\nethylene glycol ketals. Dry hydrogen chloride\nprotonates the oxygen of\nthe carbonyl compounds\nand therefore, increases\nthe electrophilicity of the\ncarbonyl carbon facilitating\n237 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nthe nucleophilic attack of ethylene glycol. Acetals and ketals\nare hydrolysed with aqueous mineral acids to yield\ncorresponding aldehydes and ketones respectively.

Reduction\n(i) Reduction to alcohols: Aldehydes and ketones are reduced to\nprimary and secondary alcohols respectively by sodium\nborohydride (NaBH ) or lithium aluminium hydride (LiAlH ) as\n4 4\nwell as by catalytic hydrogenation (Unit 7, Class XII).", "(ii) Reduction to hydrocarbons: The carbonyl group of aldehydes\nand ketones is reduced to CH group on treatment with zinc-\n2\namalgam and concentrated hydrochloric acid [Clemmensen\nChemistry 238\nReprint 2025-26\nreduction] or with hydrazine followed by heating with sodium\nor potassium hydroxide in high boiling solvent such as ethylene\nglycol (Wolff-Kishner reduction). 3. Oxidation\nAldehydes differ from ketones in their oxidation reactions. Aldehydes\nBernhard Tollens\nare easily oxidised to carboxylic acids on treatment with common\n(1841-1918) was a\noxidising agents like nitric acid, potassium permanganate, potassium\nProfessor of Chemistry\ndichromate, etc. Even mild oxidising agents, mainly Tollens’ reagent\nat the University of\nand Fehlings’ reagent also oxidise aldehydes. Gottingen, Germany. Ketones are generally oxidised under vigorous conditions, i.e.,\nstrong oxidising agents and at elevated temperatures. Their oxidation\ninvolves carbon-carbon bond cleavage to afford a mixture of carboxylic\nacids having lesser number of carbon atoms than the parent ketone. The mild oxidising agents given below are used to distinguish\naldehydes from ketones:\n(i) Tollens’ test: On warming an aldehyde with freshly prepared\nammoniacal silver nitrate solution (Tollens’ reagent), a bright\nsilver mirror is produced due to the formation of silver metal. The aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. The reaction occurs in alkaline medium. (ii) Fehling’s test: Fehling reagent comprises of two solutions,\nFehling solution A and Fehling solution B. Fehling solution A is\naqueous copper sulphate and Fehling solution B is alkaline\nsodium potassium tartarate (Rochelle salt). These two solutions\nare mixed in equal amounts before test. On heating an aldehyde\nwith Fehling’s reagent, a reddish brown precipitate is obtained. Aldehydes are oxidised to corresponding carboxylate anion. Aromatic aldehydes do not respond to this test. 239 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Oxidation of methyl ketones by haloform reaction:\nAldehydes and ketones having at least one methyl group\nlinked to the carbonyl carbon atom (methyl ketones)\nare oxidised by sodium hypohalite to sodium salts of\ncorresponding carboxylic\nacids having one carbon\natom less than that of\ncarbonyl compound.

The molecular formula of (A) indicates high degree of unsaturation, yet\nit does not decolourise bromine water or Baeyer’s reagent. This indicates\nthe presence of unsaturation due to an aromatic ring. Compound (B), being an oxidation product of a ketone should be a\ncarboxylic acid. The molecular formula of (B) indicates that it should\nbe benzoic acid and compound (A) should, therefore, be a\nmonosubstituted aromatic methyl ketone.

Reactions due to a-hydrogen\nAcidity of ααααα-hydrogens of aldehydes and ketones: The aldehydes\nand ketones undergo a number of reactions due to the acidic nature\nof α-hydrogen. The acidity of α-hydrogen atoms of carbonyl compounds is due\nto the strong electron withdrawing effect of the carbonyl group and\nresonance stabilisation of the conjugate base. (i) Aldol condensation: Aldehydes and ketones having at least one\nα-hydrogen undergo a reaction in the presence of dilute alkali\nas catalyst to form β-hydroxy aldehydes (aldol) or β-hydroxy\nketones (ketol), respectively. This is known as Aldol reaction. The name aldol is derived from the names of the two\nfunctional groups, aldehyde and alcohol, present in the products. The aldol and ketol readily lose water to giveα,β-unsaturated\ncarbonyl compounds which are aldol condensation products\nand the reaction is called Aldol condensation. Though ketones\ngive ketols (compounds containing a keto and alcohol groups),\nthe general name aldol condensation still applies to the reactions\nof ketones due to their similarity with aldehydes. 241 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Cross aldol condensation: When aldol condensation is carried\nout between two different aldehydes and / or ketones, it is called\ncross aldol condensation.

Ketones can also be used as one component in the cross aldol\nreactions. 5.

For naming compounds containing more than one\ncarboxyl group, the alkyl chain leaving carboxyl groups is numbered\nand the number of carboxyl groups is indicated by adding the\nmultiplicative prefix, dicarboxylic acid, tricarboxylic acid, etc. to the name\nof parent alkyl chain. The position of –COOH groups are indicated by the\narabic numeral before the multiplicative prefix. Some of the carboxylic\nacids along with their common and IUPAC names are listed in Table 8.3.

The entire side chain is oxidised to the carboxyl group\nirrespective of length of the side chain. Primary and secondary alkyl\ngroups are oxidised in this manner while tertiary group is not affected. Suitably substituted alkenes are also oxidised to carboxylic acids\nwith these oxidising reagents. 3. From nitriles and amides\nNitriles are hydrolysed to amides and then to acids in the presence of\n\nH+ or OHas catalyst. Mild reaction conditions are used to stop the\nreaction at the amide stage. 4. From Grignard reagents\nGrignard reagents react with carbon dioxide (dry ice) to form salts of\ncarboxylic acids which in turn give corresponding carboxylic acids\nafter acidification with mineral acid. As we know, the Grignard reagents and nitriles can be prepared\nfrom alkyl halides (refer Unit 6, Class XII). The above methods\nChemistry 246\nReprint 2025-26\n(3 and 4) are useful for converting alkyl halides into corresponding\ncarboxylic acids having one carbon atom more than that present in\nalkyl halides (ascending the series). 5. From acyl halides and anhydrides\nAcid chlorides when hydrolysed with water give carboxylic acids or more\nreadily hydrolysed with aqueous base to give carboxylate ions which on\nacidification provide corresponding carboxylic acids. Anhydrides on the\nother hand are hydrolysed to corresponding acid(s) with water. 6. From esters\nAcidic hydrolysis of esters gives directly carboxylic acids while basic\nhydrolysis gives carboxylates, which on acidification give\ncorresponding carboxylic acids.

Carboxylic acids are higher boiling\nliquids than aldehydes, ketones and even alcohols of\ncomparable molecular masses.", "This is due to more extensive\nassociation of carboxylic acid molecules through\nintermolecular hydrogen bonding. The hydrogen bonds are\nnot broken completely even in the vapour phase. In fact,\nIn vapour state or in most carboxylic acids exist as dimer in the vapour phase\naprotic solvent or in the aprotic solvents. Simple aliphatic carboxylic acids having upto four\ncarbon atoms are miscible in water due to the formation\nof hydrogen bonds with water. The solubility decreases\nwith increasing number of carbon atoms. Higher\ncarboxylic acids are practically insoluble in water due to\nthe increased hydrophobic interaction of hydrocarbon\npart. Benzoic acid, the simplest aromatic carboxylic acid\nis nearly insoluble in cold water. Carboxylic acids are\nHydrogen bonding of\nalso soluble in less polar organic solvents like benzene,\nRCOOH with H O\n2\nether, alcohol, chloroform, etc. 88888.....99999 CCCCChhhhheeeeemmmmmiiiiicccccaaaaalllll RRRRReeeeeaaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss The reaction of carboxylic acids are classified as follows:\n8.9.1 Reactions Acidity\nInvolving\nReactions with metals and alkalies\nCleavage of\nThe carboxylic acids like alcohols evolve hydrogen with electropositive\nO–H Bond\nmetals and form salts with alkalies similar to phenols. However, unlike\nphenols they react with weaker bases such as carbonates and\nhydrogencarbonates to evolve carbon dioxide. This reaction is used to\ndetect the presence of carboxyl group in an organic compound. Carboxylic acids dissociate in water to give resonance stabilised\ncarboxylate anions and hydronium ion. 249 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\nFor the above reaction:\nwhere K , is equilibrium constant and K is the acid dissociation\neq a\nconstant. For convenience, the strength of an acid is generally indicated by\nits pK value rather than its K value. a a\npK = – log K\na a\nThe pK of hydrochloric acid is –7.0, where as pK of trifluoroacetic\na a\nacid (the strongest carboxylic acid), benzoic acid and acetic acid are\n0.23, 4.19 and 4.76, respectively. Smaller the pK , the stronger the acid ( the better it is as a proton\na\ndonor). Strong acids have pK values < 1, the acids with pK values\na a\nbetween 1 and 5 are considered to be moderately strong acids, weak\nacids have pK values between 5 and 15, and extremely weak acids\na\nhave pK values >15. a\nCarboxylic acids are weaker than mineral acids, but they are stronger\nacids than alcohols and many simple phenols (pK is ~16 for ethanol\na\nand 10 for phenol). In fact, carboxylic acids are amongst the most acidic\norganic compounds you have studied so far. You already know why\nphenols are more acidic than alcohols. The higher acidity of carboxylic\nacids as compared to phenols can be understood similarly. The conjugate\nbase of carboxylic acid, a carboxylate ion, is stabilised by two equivalent\nresonance structures in which the negative charge is at the more\nelectronegative oxygen atom.", "The conjugate base of phenol, a phenoxide\nion, has non-equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge\nis at the less electronegative carbon atom. Therefore, resonance in\nphenoxide ion is not as important as it is in carboxylate ion. Further, the\nnegative charge is delocalised over two electronegative oxygen atoms in\ncarboxylate ion whereas it is less effectively delocalised over one oxygen\natom and less electronegative carbon atoms in phenoxide ion (Unit 7,\nClass XII). Thus, the carboxylate ion is more stabilised than phenoxide\nion, so carboxylic acids are more acidic than phenols. Effect of substituents on the acidity of carboxylic acids:\nSubstituents may affect the stability of the conjugate base and thus,\nalso affect the acidity of the carboxylic acids. Electron withdrawing\ngroups increase the acidity of carboxylic acids by stabilising the\nconjugate base through delocalisation of the negative charge by\ninductive and/or resonance effects. Conversely, electron donating groups\ndecrease the acidity by destabilising the conjugate base. Electron withdrawing group (EWG) Electron donating group (EDG)\nstabilises the carboxylate anion destabilises the carboxylate\nand strengthens the acid anion and weakens the acid\nChemistry 250\nReprint 2025-26\nThe effect of the following groups in increasing acidity order is\nPh < I < Br < Cl < F < CN < NO < CF\n2 3\nThus, the following acids are arranged in order of increasing acidity\n(based on pK values):\na\nCF COOH > CCl COOH > CHCl COOH > NO CH COOH > NC-CH COOH >\n3 3 2 2 2 2\nFCH COOH > ClCH COOH > BrCH COOH > HCOOH > ClCH CH COOH >\n2 2 2 2 2\n(continue)\nC H COOH > C H CH COOH > CH COOH > CH CH COOH\n6 5 6 5 2 3 3 2\n(continue )\nDirect attachment of groups such as phenyl or vinyl to the carboxylic\nacid, increases the acidity of corresponding carboxylic acid, contrary to\nthe decrease expected due to resonance effect shown below:\nThis is because of greater electronegativity of sp2 hybridised carbon\nto which carboxyl carbon is attached. The presence of electron\nwithdrawing group on the phenyl of aromatic carboxylic acid increases\ntheir acidity while electron donating groups decrease their acidity.

Protonation of the\ncarbonyl oxygen activates the carbonyl group towards nucleophilic addition of the\nalcohol.", "Proton transfer in the tetrahedral intermediate converts the hydroxyl group\ninto –+OH group, which, being a better leaving group, is eliminated as neutral water\n2\nmolecule. The protonated ester so formed finally loses a proton to give the ester. 3. Reactions with PCl , PCl and SOCl\n5 3 2\nThe hydroxyl group of carboxylic acids, behaves like that of alcohols\nand is easily replaced by chlorine atom on treating with PCl , PCl or\n5 3\nSOCl . Thionyl chloride (SOCl ) is preferred because the other two\n2 2\nproducts are gaseous and escape the reaction mixture making the\npurification of the products easier. 4. Reaction with ammonia\nCarboxylic acids react with ammonia to give ammonium salt which\non further heating at high temperature give amides. For example:\nChemistry 252\nReprint 2025-26\n8.9.3 Reactions 1. Reduction\nInvolving\nCarboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols by lithium\n–COOH\naluminium hydride or better with diborane. Diborane does not easily\nGroup\nreduce functional groups such as ester, nitro, halo, etc. Sodium\nborohydride does not reduce the carboxyl group. 2. Decarboxylation\nCarboxylic acids lose carbon dioxide to form hydrocarbons when their\nsodium salts are heated with sodalime (NaOH and CaO in the ratio of\n3 : 1). The reaction is known as decarboxylation. Alkali metal salts of carboxylic acids also undergo decarboxylation\non electrolysis of their aqueous solutions and form hydrocarbons having\ntwice the number of carbon atoms present in the alkyl group of the acid. The reaction is known as Kolbe electrolysis (Unit 9, Class XI). 8.9.4 Substitution 1. Halogenation\nReactions in the Carboxylic acids having an α-hydrogen are halogenated at the\nHydrocarbon Part α-position on treatment with chlorine or bromine in the presence of\nsmall amount of red phosphorus to give α-halocarboxylic acids. The\nreaction is known as Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. 253 Aldehydes, Ketones and Carboxylic Acids\nReprint 2025-26\n2. Ring substitution\nAromatic carboxylic acids undergo electrophilic substitution reactions\nin which the carboxyl group acts as a deactivating and meta-directing\ngroup. They however, do not undergo Friedel-Crafts reaction\n(because the carboxyl group is deactivating and the catalyst\naluminium chloride (Lewis acid) gets bonded to the carboxyl group).

SSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nAldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids are some of the important classes of\norganic compounds containing carbonyl group. These are highly polar molecules. Therefore, they boil at higher temperatures than the hydrocarbons and weakly\npolar compounds such as ethers of comparable molecular masses. The lower\nmembers are more soluble in water because they form hydrogen bonds with water. The higher members, because of large size of hydrophobic chain of carbon atoms,\nare insoluble in water but soluble in common organic solvents. Aldehydes are\nprepared by dehydrogenation or controlled oxidation of primary alcohols and\ncontrolled or selective reduction of acyl halides. Aromatic aldehydes may also be\nprepared by oxidation of (i) methylbenzene with chromyl chloride or CrO in the\n3\npresence of acetic anhydride, (ii) formylation of arenes with carbon monoxide and\nhydrochloric acid in the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, and (iii) cuprous\nchloride or by hydrolysis of benzal chloride. Ketones are prepared by oxidation of\nsecondary alcohols and hydration of alkynes. Ketones are also prepared by reaction\nof acyl chloride with dialkylcadmium. A good method for the preparation of aromatic\nketones is the Friedel-Crafts acylation of aromatic hydrocarbons with acyl chlorides\nor anhydrides. Both aldehydes and ketones can be prepared by ozonolysis of alkenes. Aldehydes and ketones undergo nucleophilic addition reactions onto the carbonyl\ngroup with a number of nucleophiles such as, HCN, NaHSO , alcohols (or diols),\n3\nChemistry 254\nReprint 2025-26\nammonia derivatives, and Grignard reagents. The a-hydrogens in aldehydes and\nketones are acidic. Therefore, aldehydes and ketones having at least one a-hydrogen,\nundergo Aldol condensation in the presence of a base to give a-hydroxyaldehydes\n(aldol) and a-hydroxyketones(ketol), respectively. Aldehydes having no a-hydrogen\nundergo Cannizzaro reaction in the presence of concentrated alkali. Aldehydes\nand ketones are reduced to alcohols with NaBH , LiAlH , or by catalytic hydrogenation. 4 4\nThe carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones can be reduced to a methylene group\nby Clemmensen reduction or Wolff-Kishner reduction. Aldehydes are easily\noxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidising reagents such as Tollens’ reagent and\nFehling’s reagent. These oxidation reactions are used to distinguish aldehydes from\nketones. Carboxylic acids are prepared by the oxidation of primary alcohols, aldehydes\nand alkenes by hydrolysis of nitriles, and by treatment of Grignard reagents with\ncarbon dioxide. Aromatic carboxylic acids are also prepared by side-chain oxidation\nof alkylbenzenes. Carboxylic acids are considerably more acidic than alcohols and\nmost of simple phenols.", "Carboxylic acids are reduced to primary alcohols with LiAlH ,\n4\nor better with diborane in ether solution and also undergo a-halogenation with Cl\n2\nand Br in the presence of red phosphorus (Hell-Volhard Zelinsky reaction). 2\nMethanal, ethanal, propanone, benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid and benzoic\nacid are highly useful compounds in industry.
