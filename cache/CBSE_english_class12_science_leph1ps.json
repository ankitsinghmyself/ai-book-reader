This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish\nlearning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and\ncommunity. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement\nthis basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly\nfurther in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on\nEducation (NPE), 1986. The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to\nencourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging\nwith the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis\nof examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in\nthe daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the\nrequired number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching\nand evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children’s life at\nschool a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried\nto address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different\nstages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for\ncontemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on\nexperience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard\nwork done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the\nChairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V.", "Narlikar and the\nChief Advisor for this book, Professor A.W. Joshi for guiding the work of this committee. Several\nteachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for\nmaking this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to\nthe members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary\nand Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of\nProfessor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time and contribution. As\nan organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further\nrevision and refinement.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the\ncontent load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative\nmindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise\nthe textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT\nacross classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-\nlearning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes\ngiven above.

Reprint 2025-26\nP\nREFACE\nIt gives me pleasure to place this book in the hands of the students, teachers and the public at\nlarge (whose role cannot be overlooked). It is a natural sequel to the Class XI textbook which\nwas brought out in 2006. This book is also a trimmed version of the textbooks which existed so\nfar. The chapter on thermal and chemical effects of current has been cut out. This topic has also\nbeen dropped from the CBSE syllabus. Similarly, the chapter on communications has been\nsubstantially curtailed. It has been rewritten in an easily comprehensible form.", "Although most other chapters have been based on the earlier versions, several parts and\nsections in them have been rewritten. The Development Team has been guided by the feedback\nreceived from innumerable teachers across the country. In producing these books, Class XI as well as Class XII, there has been a basic change of\nemphasis. Both the books present physics to students without assuming that they would pursue\nthis subject beyond the higher secondary level. This new view has been prompted by the various\nobservations and suggestions made in the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005. Similarly, in today’s educational scenario where students can opt for various combinations of\nsubjects, we cannot assume that a physics student is also studying mathematics. Therefore,\nphysics has to be presented, so to say, in a standalone form. As in Class XI textbook, some interesting box items have been inserted in many chapters. They are not meant for teaching or examinations. Their purpose is to catch the attention of the\nreader, to show some applications in daily life or in other areas of science and technology, to\nsuggest a simple experiment, to show connection of concepts in different areas of physics, and\nin general, to break the monotony and enliven the book. Features like Summary, Points to Ponder, Exercises and Additional Exercises at the end of\neach chapter, and Examples have been retained. Several concept-based Exercises have been\ntransferred from end-of-chapter Exercises to Examples with Solutions in the text. It is hoped\nthat this will make the concepts discussed in the chapter more comprehensible. Several new\nexamples and exercises have been added. Students wishing to pursue physics further would\nfind Points to Ponder and Additional Exercises very useful and thoughtful. To provide resources\nbeyond the textbook and to encourage eLearning, each chapter has been provided with\nsome relevant website addresses under the title ePhysics. These sites provide additional\nmaterial on specific topics and also provide learners with opportunites for interactive\ndemonstrations/experiments. The intricate concepts of physics must be understood, comprehended and appreciated. Students must learn to ask questions like ‘why’, ‘how’, ‘how do we know it’. They will find\nalmost always that the question ‘why’ has no answer within the domain of physics and science\nin general. But that itself is a learning experience, is it not? On the other hand, the question\n‘how’ has been reasonably well answered by physicists in the case of most natural phenomena. In fact, with the understanding of how things happen, it has been possible to make use of many\nphenomena to create technological applications for the use of humans. For example, consider statements in a book, like ‘A negatively charged electron is attracted\nby the positively charged plate’, or ‘In this experiment, light (or electron) behaves like a wave’. You will realise that it is not possible to answer ‘why’.", "This question belongs to the domain of\nphilosophy or metaphysics. But we can answer ‘how’, we can find the force acting, we can find\nReprint 2025-26\nthe wavelength of the photon (or electron), we can determine how things behave under different\nconditions, and we can develop instruments which will use these phenomena to our advantage. It has been a pleasure to work for these books at the higher secondary level, along with a\nteam of members. The Textbook Development Team, Review Team and Editing Teams involved\ncollege and university teachers, teachers from Indian Institutes of Technology, scientists from\nnational institutes and laboratories, as well as, higher secondary teachers. The feedback and\ncritical look provided by higher secondary teachers in the various teams are highly laudable. Most box items were generated by members of one or the other team, but three of them were\ngenerated by friends and well-wishers not part of any team. We are thankful to Dr P.N. Sen of\nPune, Professor Roopmanjari Ghosh of Delhi and Dr Rajesh B Khaparde of Mumbai for allowing\nus to use their box items, respectively, in Chapters 3, 4 (Part I) and 9 (Part II). We are thankful\nto the members of the review and editing workshops to discuss and refine the first draft of the\ntextbook. We also express our gratitude to Prof. Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, for entrusting\nus with the task of presenting this textbook as a part of the national effort for improving science\neducation. I also thank Prof. G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT, for his help from time-to-\ntime. Prof. Hukum Singh, Head, Department of Education in Science and Mathematics, NCERT,\nwas always willing to help us in our endeavour in every possible way. We welcome suggestions and comments from our valued users, especially students and\nteachers. We wish our young readers a happy journey into the exciting realm of physics. A.
