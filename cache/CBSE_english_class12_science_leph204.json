["Physics\nChapter Twelve\nATOMS\n12.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nBy the nineteenth century, enough evidence had accumulated in favour of\natomic hypothesis of matter. In 1897, the experiments on electric discharge\nthrough gases carried out by the English physicist J. J. Thomson (1856 –\n1940) revealed that atoms of different elements contain negatively charged\nconstituents (electrons) that are identical for all atoms. However, atoms on a\nwhole are electrically neutral. Therefore, an atom must also contain some\npositive charge to neutralise the negative charge of the electrons. But what\nis the arrangement of the positive charge and the electrons inside the atom? In other words, what is the structure of an atom? The first model of atom was proposed by J. J. Thomson in 1898. According to this model, the positive charge of the atom is uniformly\ndistributed throughout the volume of the atom and the negatively charged\nelectrons are embedded in it like seeds in a watermelon. This model was\npicturesquely called plum pudding model of the atom. However\nsubsequent studies on atoms, as described in this chapter, showed that\nthe distribution of the electrons and positive charges are very different\nfrom that proposed in this model. We know that condensed matter (solids and liquids) and dense gases at\nall temperatures emit electromagnetic radiation in which a continuous\ndistribution of several wavelengths is present, though with different\n290\nintensities. This radiation is considered to be due to oscillations of atoms\nReprint 2025-26\nAtoms\nand molecules, governed by the interaction of each atom or\nmolecule with its neighbours. In contrast, light emitted from\nrarefied gases heated in a flame, or excited electrically in a\nglow tube such as the familiar neon sign or mercury vapour\nlight has only certain discrete wavelengths. The spectrum\nappears as a series of bright lines. In such gases, the\naverage spacing between atoms is large. Hence, the\nradiation emitted can be considered due to individual atoms\nrather than because of interactions between atoms or\nmolecules. In the early nineteenth century it was also established\nthat each element is associated with a characteristic\nspectrum of radiation, for example, hydrogen always gives\na set of lines with fixed relative position between the lines.

How could an atom as simple as hydrogen,\nconsisting of a single electron and a single proton, emit a complex\nspectrum of specific wavelengths? In the classical picture of an atom, the\nelectron revolves round the nucleus much like the way a planet revolves\nround the sun. However, we shall see that there are some serious\ndifficulties in accepting such a model. 1111122222.....22222 AAAAA ----- SSSSS\nLLLLLPPPPPHHHHHAAAAA PPPPPAAAAARRRRRTTTTTIIIIICCCCCLLLLLEEEEE CCCCCAAAAATTTTTTTTTTEEEEERRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGG AAAAANNNNNDDDDD\nRRRRR ’’’’’ NNNNN MMMMM AAAAA\nUUUUUTTTTTHHHHHEEEEERRRRRFFFFFOOOOORRRRRDDDDD SSSSS UUUUUCCCCCLLLLLEEEEEAAAAARRRRR OOOOODDDDDEEEEELLLLL OOOOOFFFFF TTTTTOOOOOMMMMM\nAt the suggestion of Ernst Rutherford, in 1911, H.

In one of their experiments, as shown in\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nFig. 12.1, they directed a beam of\n5.5 MeV a-particles emitted from a\n214Bi radioactive source at a thin metal\n83\nfoil made of gold. Figure 12.2 shows a\nschematic diagram of this experiment. Alpha-particles emitted by a 214Bi\n83\nradioactive source were collimated into\na narrow beam by their passage\nthrough lead bricks. The beam was\nallowed to fall on a thin foil of gold of\nthickness 2.1 × 10–7 m.

Then the incoming α-particle could get\nvery close to the positive charge without\npenetrating it, and such a close\nencounter would result in a large\ndeflection. This agreement supported\nthe hypothesis of the nuclear atom. This\nis why Rutherford is credited with the\ndiscovery of the nucleus.

The\nelectrons would be moving in orbits\nFFFFFIIIIIGGGGGUUUUURRRRREEEEE 1111122222.....33333 Experimental data points (shown by\nabout the nucleus just as the planets\ndots) on scattering of α-particles by a thin foil at\ndo around the sun. Rutherford’s\ndifferent angles obtained by Geiger and Marsden\nexperiments suggested the size of\nusing the setup shown in Figs. 12.1 and\nthe nucleus to be about 10–15 m to 12.2. Rutherford’s nuclear model predicts the solid\n10–14 m. From kinetic theory, the size curve which is seen to be in good agreement with\nof an atom was known to be 10–10 m, experiment. about 10,000 to 100,000 times larger\nthan the size of the nucleus. Thus, the electrons would seem to be at a\ndistance from the nucleus of about 10,000 to 100,000 times the size of\nthe nucleus itself. Thus, most of an atom is empty space. With the atom\nbeing largely empty space, it is easy to see why most α-particles go right\nthrough a thin metal foil. However, when α-particle happens to come\nnear a nucleus, the intense electric field there scatters it through a large\nangle. The atomic electrons, being so light, do not appreciably affect the\nα-particles. The scattering data shown in Fig. 12.3 can be analysed by employing\nRutherford’s nuclear model of the atom.", "As the gold foil is very thin, it\ncan be assumed that α-particles will suffer not more than one scattering\nduring their passage through it. Therefore, computation of the trajectory\nof an alpha-particle scattered by a single nucleus is enough. Alpha-\nparticles are nuclei of helium atoms and, therefore, carry two units, 2e,\nof positive charge and have the mass of the helium atom. The charge of\nthe gold nucleus is Ze, where Z is the atomic number of the atom; for\ngold Z = 79. Since the nucleus of gold is about 50 times heavier than an\nα-particle, it is reasonable to assume that it remains stationary\nthroughout the scattering process. Under these assumptions, the\ntrajectory of an alpha-particle can be computed employing Newton’s\nsecond law of motion and the Coulomb’s law for electrostatic\nforce of repulsion between the alpha-particle and the positively\ncharged nucleus. 293\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nThe magnitude of this force is\n1 (2e)(Ze)\nF =\n4p e r2 (12.1)\n0\nwhere r is the distance between the a-particle and the nucleus. The force\nis directed along the line joining the a-particle and the nucleus. The\nmagnitude and direction of the force on an a-particle continuously\nchanges as it approaches the nucleus and recedes away from it. 12.2.1 Alpha-particle trajectory\nThe trajectory traced by an a-particle depends on the impact parameter,\nb of collision. The impact parameter is the perpendicular distance of the\ninitial velocity vector of the a-particle from the centre of the nucleus (Fig. 12.4). A given beam of a-particles has a\ndistribution of impact parameters b, so that\nthe beam is scattered in various directions\nwith different probabilities (Fig. 12.4). (In\na beam, all particles have nearly same\nkinetic energy.) It is seen that an a-particle\nclose to the nucleus (small impact\nparameter) suffers large scattering. In case\nof head-on collision, the impact parameter\nis minimum and the a-particle rebounds\nback (q @ p). For a large impact parameter,\nthe a-particle goes nearly undeviated and\nhas a small deflection (q @ 0).

This,\nin turn, implies that the mass and positive charge of the atom is\nconcentrated in a small volume. Rutherford scattering therefore, is a\npowerful way to determine an upper limit to the size of the nucleus. Example 12.1 In the Rutherford’s nuclear model of the atom, the\nnucleus (radius about 10–15 m) is analogous to the sun about which\nthe electron move in orbit (radius » 10–10 m) like the earth orbits\naround the sun. If the dimensions of the solar system had the same\nproportions as those of the atom, would the earth be closer to or\nfarther away from the sun than actually it is? The radius of earth’s\norbit is about 1.5 · 1011 m.", "The radius of sun is taken as 7 · 108 m. Solution The ratio of the radius of electron’s orbit to the radius of\nnucleus is (10–10 m)/(10–15 m) = 105, that is, the radius of the electron’s\norbit is 105 times larger than the radius of nucleus. If the radius of\nthe earth’s orbit around the sun were 105 times larger than the radius\n1.21\nof the sun, the radius of the earth’s orbit would be 105 · 7 · 108 m =\n7 · 1013 m. This is more than 100 times greater than the actual\nELPMAXE orbital radius of earth. Thus, the earth would be much farther away\nfrom the sun. It implies that an atom contains a much greater fraction of empty\n294 space than our solar system does. Reprint 2025-26\nAtoms\nExample 12.2 In a Geiger-Marsden experiment, what is the distance\nof closest approach to the nucleus of a 7.7 MeV a-particle before it\ncomes momentarily to rest and reverses its direction? Solution The key idea here is that throughout the scattering process,\nthe total mechanical energy of the system consisting of an a-particle\nand a gold nucleus is conserved. The system’s initial mechanical\nenergy is E, before the particle and nucleus interact, and it is equal\ni\nto its mechanical energy E when the a-particle momentarily stops. f\nThe initial energy E is just the kinetic energy Kof the incoming\ni\na- particle. The final energy E is just the electric potential energy U\nf\nof the system. The potential energy U can be calculated from\nEq. (12.1). Let d be the centre-to-centre distance between the a-particle and\nthe gold nucleus when the a-particle is at its stopping point. Then\nwe can write the conservation of energy E = E as\ni f\n1 (2e)(Ze) 2Ze2\nK = =\n4p e d 4p e d\n0 0\nThus the distance of closest approach d is given by\n2Ze2\nd =\n4p e K\n0\nThe maximum kinetic energy found in a-particles of natural origin is\n7.7 MeV or 1.2 × 10–12 J.

(1 fm (i.e. fermi) = 10–15 m.)\nThe radius of gold nucleus is, therefore, less than 3.0 × 10–14 m. This EXAMPLE\nis not in very good agreement with the observed result as the actual\nradius of gold nucleus is 6 fm. The cause of discrepancy is that the\ndistance of closest approach is considerably larger than the sum of\nthe radii of the gold nucleus and the a-particle. Thus, the a-particle 12.2\nreverses its motion without ever actually touching the gold nucleus. 12.2.2 Electron orbits\nThe Rutherford nuclear model of the atom which involves classical\nconcepts, pictures the atom as an electrically neutral sphere consisting\nof a very small, massive and positively charged nucleus at the centre\nsurrounded by the revolving electrons in their respective dynamically\nstable orbits.", "The electrostatic force of attraction, F between the revolving\ne\nelectrons and the nucleus provides the requisite centripetal force (F ) to\nc\nkeep them in their orbits.

It was Niels Bohr (1885 – 1962) who made certain modifications in\nthis model by adding the ideas of the newly developing quantum\nhypothesis. Niels Bohr studied in Rutherford’s laboratory for several\nmonths in 1912 and he was convinced about the validity of Rutherford\nnuclear model. Faced with the dilemma as discussed above, Bohr, in\n1913, concluded that in spite of the success of electromagnetic theory in\nexplaining large-scale phenomena, it could not be applied to the processes\nat the atomic scale.", "It became clear that a fairly radical departure from\nthe established principles of classical mechanics and electromagnetism\nwould be needed to understand the structure of atoms and the relation\nof atomic structure to atomic spectra. Bohr combined classical and early\nquantum concepts and gave his theory in the form of three postulates. These are :\n(i) Bohr’s first postulate was that an electron in an atom could revolve\nin certain stable orbits without the emission of radiant energy,\ncontrary to the predictions of electromagnetic theory. According to\n298 this postulate, each atom has certain definite stable states in which it\nReprint 2025-26\nAtoms\ncan exist, and each possible state has definite total energy. These are\ncalled the stationary states of the atom. (ii) Bohr’s second postulate defines these stable orbits. This postulate\nstates that the electron revolves around the nucleus only in those\norbits for which the angular momentum is some integral multiple of\nh/2π where h is the Planck’s constant (= 6.6 × 10–34 J s). Thus the\nangular momentum (L) of the orbiting electron is quantised. That is\nL = nh/2π (12.5)\n(iii) Bohr’s third postulate incorporated into atomic theory the early\nquantum concepts that had been developed by Planck and Einstein. It states that an electron might make a transition from one of its\nspecified non-radiating orbits to another of lower energy. When it\ndoes so, a photon is emitted having energy equal to the energy\ndifference between the initial and final states. The frequency of the\nemitted photon is then given by\nhν = E – E (12.6)\ni f\nwhere E and E are the energies of the initial and final states and E > E . i f i f\nFor a hydrogen atom, Eq.

It states\nthat the angular momentum of the electron orbiting around\nthe nucleus is quantised (that is, L = nh/2p; n = 1, 2, 3 …). n\nWhy should the angular momentum have only those values\nthat are integral multiples of h/2p? The French physicist Louis\nde Broglie explained this puzzle in 1923, ten years after Bohr\nproposed his model. We studied, in Chapter 11, about the de Broglie’s\nhypothesis that material particles, such as electrons, also\nhave a wave nature. C. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer later\nexperimentally verified the wave nature of electrons in 1927. Louis de Broglie argued that the electron in its circular orbit,\nas proposed by Bohr, must be seen as a particle wave. In\nanalogy to waves travelling on a string, particle waves too\ncan lead to standing waves under resonant conditions. From FIGURE 12.8 A standing wave\nChapter 14 of Class XI Physics textbook, we know that when is shown on a circular orbit\na string is plucked, a vast number of wavelengths are excited. where four de Broglie\nwavelengths fit into the\nHowever only those wavelengths survive which have nodes\ncircumference of the orbit. at the ends and form the standing wave in the string.", "It means\nthat in a string, standing waves are formed when the total distance\ntravelled by a wave down the string and back is one wavelength, two\nwavelengths, or any integral number of wavelengths. Waves with other\nwavelengths interfere with themselves upon reflection and their\namplitudes quickly drop to zero. For an electron moving in nth circular\norbit of radius r , the total distance is the circumference of the orbit,\nn 301\n2pr . Thus\nn\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n2p r = nl, n = 1, 2, 3... (12.12)\nn\nFigure 12.8 illustrates a standing particle wave on a circular orbit\nfor n = 4, i.e., 2pr = 4l, where l is the de Broglie wavelength of the electron\nn\nmoving in nth orbit. From Chapter 11, we have l = h/p, where p is the\nmagnitude of the electron’s momentum. If the speed of the electron is\nmuch less than the speed of light, the momentum is mv . Thus, l = h/\nn\nmv . From Eq. (12.12), we have\nn\n2p r = n h/mv or m v r = nh/2p\nn n n n\nThis is the quantum condition proposed by Bohr for the angular\nmomentum of the electron [Eq. (12.15)]. In Section 12.5, we saw that\nthis equation is the basis of explaining the discrete orbits and energy\nlevels in hydrogen atom. Thus de Broglie hypothesis provided an\nexplanation for Bohr’s second postulate for the quantisation of angular\nmomentum of the orbiting electron. The quantised electron orbits and\nenergy states are due to the wave nature of the electron and only resonant\nstanding waves can persist. Bohr’s model, involving classical trajectory picture (planet-like electron\norbiting the nucleus), correctly predicts the gross features of the\nhydrogenic atoms*, in particular, the frequencies of the radiation emitted\nor selectively absorbed. This model however has many limitations. Some are:\n(i) The Bohr model is applicable to hydrogenic atoms. It cannot be\nextended even to mere two electron atoms such as helium. The analysis\nof atoms with more than one electron was attempted on the lines of\nBohr’s model for hydrogenic atoms but did not meet with any success. Difficulty lies in the fact that each electron interacts not only with the\npositively charged nucleus but also with all other electrons. The formulation of Bohr model involves electrical force between\npositively charged nucleus and electron. It does not include the\nelectrical forces between electrons which necessarily appear in\nmulti-electron atoms. (ii) While the Bohr’s model correctly predicts the frequencies of the light\nemitted by hydrogenic atoms, the model is unable to explain the\nrelative intensities of the frequencies in the spectrum. In emission\nspectrum of hydrogen, some of the visible frequencies have weak\nintensity, others strong. Why? Experimental observations depict that\nsome transitions are more favoured than others. Bohr’s model is\nunable to account for the intensity variations. Bohr’s model presents an elegant picture of an atom and cannot be\ngeneralised to complex atoms.", "For complex atoms we have to use a new\nand radical theory based on Quantum Mechanics, which provides a more\ncomplete picture of the atomic structure. * Hydrogenic atoms are the atoms consisting of a nucleus with positive charge\n+Ze and a single electron, where Z is the proton number. Examples are hydrogen\natom, singly ionised helium, doubly ionised lithium, and so forth. In these\n302 atoms more complex electron-electron interactions are nonexistent. Reprint 2025-26\nAtoms\nSUMMARY\n1. Atom, as a whole, is electrically neutral and therefore contains equal\namount of positive and negative charges. 2. In Thomson’s model, an atom is a spherical cloud of positive charges\nwith electrons embedded in it. 3. In Rutherford’s model, most of the mass of the atom and all its positive\ncharge are concentrated in a tiny nucleus (typically one by ten thousand\nthe size of an atom), and the electrons revolve around it. 4. Rutherford nuclear model has two main difficulties in explaining the\nstructure of atom: (a) It predicts that atoms are unstable because the\naccelerated electrons revolving around the nucleus must spiral into\nthe nucleus. This contradicts the stability of matter. (b) It cannot\nexplain the characteristic line spectra of atoms of different elements. 5. Atoms of most of the elements are stable and emit characteristic\nspectrum. The spectrum consists of a set of isolated parallel lines\ntermed as line spectrum. It provides useful information about the\natomic structure. 6. To explain the line spectra emitted by atoms, as well as the stability\nof atoms, Niel’s Bohr proposed a model for hydrogenic (single elctron)\natoms. He introduced three postulates and laid the foundations of\nquantum mechanics:\n(a) In a hydrogen atom, an electron revolves in certain stable orbits\n(called stationary orbits) without the emission of radiant energy. (b) The stationary orbits are those for which the angular momentum\nis some integral multiple of h/2p. (Bohr’s quantisation condition.)\nThat is L = nh/2p, where n is an integer called the principal\nquantum number. (c) The third postulate states that an electron might make a transition\nfrom one of its specified non-radiating orbits to another of lower\nenergy. When it does so, a photon is emitted having energy equal\nto the energy difference between the initial and final states. The\nfrequency (n) of the emitted photon is then given by\nhn = E – E\ni f\nAn atom absorbs radiation of the same frequency the atom emits,\nin which case the electron is transferred to an orbit with a higher\nvalue of n. E + hn = E\ni f\n7. As a result of the quantisation condition of angular momentum, the\nelectron orbits the nucleus at only specific radii. For a hydrogen atom\nit is given by\nn2 h 2 4πε\nr =   2π e20\nn m\nThe total energy is also quantised:\nme4\nE = −\nn 8n2ε2h2\n0\n= –13.6 eV/n2\nThe n = 1 state is called ground state. In hydrogen atom the ground\nstate energy is –13.6 eV. Higher values of n correspond to excited\nstates (n > 1).", "Atoms are excited to these higher states by collisions\nwith other atoms or electrons or by absorption of a photon of right\nfrequency. 303\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n8. de Broglie’s hypothesis that electrons have a wavelength λ = h/mv gave\nan explanation for Bohr’s quantised orbits by bringing in the wave-\nparticle duality. The orbits correspond to circular standing waves in\nwhich the circumference of the orbit equals a whole number of\nwavelengths. 9. Bohr’s model is applicable only to hydrogenic (single electron) atoms. It cannot be extended to even two electron atoms such as helium. This model is also unable to explain for the relative intensities of the\nfrequencies emitted even by hydrogenic atoms. PPPPPOOOOOIIIIINNNNNTTTTTSSSSS TTTTTOOOOO PPPPPOOOOONNNNNDDDDDEEEEERRRRR\n1. Both the Thomson’s as well as the Rutherford’s models constitute an\nunstable system. Thomson’s model is unstable electrostatically, while\nRutherford’s model is unstable because of electromagnetic radiation\nof orbiting electrons. 2. What made Bohr quantise angular momentum (second postulate) and\nnot some other quantity? Note, h has dimensions of angular\nmomentum, and for circular orbits, angular momentum is a very\nrelevant quantity. The second postulate is then so natural! 3. The orbital picture in Bohr’s model of the hydrogen atom was\ninconsistent with the uncertainty principle. It was replaced by modern\nquantum mechanics in which Bohr’s orbits are regions where the\nelectron may be found with large probability. 4. Unlike the situation in the solar system, where planet-planet\ngravitational forces are very small as compared to the gravitational\nforce of the sun on each planet (because the mass of the sun is so\nmuch greater than the mass of any of the planets), the electron-electron\nelectric force interaction is comparable in magnitude to the electron-\nnucleus electrical force, because the charges and distances are of the\nsame order of magnitude. This is the reason why the Bohr’s model\nwith its planet-like electron is not applicable to many electron atoms. 5. Bohr laid the foundation of the quantum theory by postulating specific\norbits in which electrons do not radiate. Bohr’s model include only\none quantum number n. The new theory called quantum mechanics\nsupports Bohr’s postulate. However in quantum mechanics (more\ngenerally accepted), a given energy level may not correspond to just\none quantum state. For example, a state is characterised by four\nquantum numbers (n, l, m, and s), but for a pure Coulomb potential\n(as in hydrogen atom) the energy depends only on n. 6. In Bohr model, contrary to ordinary classical expectation, the frequency\nof revolution of an electron in its orbit is not connected to the frequency\nof spectral line. The later is the difference between two orbital energies\ndivided by h. For transitions between large quantum numbers (n to n\n– 1, n very large), however, the two coincide as expected. 7.", "Bohr’s semiclassical model based on some aspects of classical physics\nand some aspects of modern physics also does not provide a true picture\nof the simplest hydrogenic atoms. The true picture is quantum\nmechanical affair which differs from Bohr model in a number of\nfundamental ways. But then if the Bohr model is not strictly correct,\nwhy do we bother about it? The reasons which make Bohr’s model\nstill useful are:\n304\nReprint 2025-26\nAtoms\n(i) The model is based on just three postulates but accounts for almost\nall the general features of the hydrogen spectrum. (ii) The model incorporates many of the concepts we have learnt in\nclassical physics. (iii) The model demonstrates how a theoretical physicist occasionally\nmust quite literally ignore certain problems of approach in hopes\nof being able to make some predictions. If the predictions of the\ntheory or model agree with experiment, a theoretician then must\nsomehow hope to explain away or rationalise the problems that\nwere ignored along the way.
