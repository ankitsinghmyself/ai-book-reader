This principle marks a departure from\nthe legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap\nbetween the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to\ndiscourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different\nsubject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction\nof a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education\n(1986).", "The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers\nwill take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative\nactivities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom,\nchildren generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them\nby adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of\nthe key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating\ncreativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in\nlearning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual\ncalendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this\ntextbook proves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather than a\nsource of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of\ncurricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with\ngreater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The\ntextbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to\nopportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and\nactivities requiring hands-on experience. Reprint 2025-26\nNCERT appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in\nScience and Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book,\nProfessor P.K. Jain for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed\nto the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this\npossible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously\npermitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. As an organisation\ncommitted to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its\nproducts, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to\nundertake further revision and refinement. Director\nNew Delhi National Council of Educational\n20 December 2005 Research and Training\nReprint 2025-26\nRationalisation of Content in the Textbook\nIn view of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative to reduce content load on\nstudents. The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content\nload and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the\ntextbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT\nacross classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise.", "Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following:\n• Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same\nclass\n• Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject\n• Difficulty level\n• Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions\nfrom teachers and can be learned by children through self-learning or peer-\nlearning\n• Content, which is irrelevant in the present context\nThis present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes\ngiven above. Reprint 2025-26\nReprint 2025-26\nPreface\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) had constituted\n21 Focus Groups on Teaching of various subjects related to School Education, to\nreview the National Curriculum Framework for School Education - 2000 (NCFSE -\n2000) in face of new emerging challenges and transformations occurring in the fields\nof content and pedagogy under the contexts of National and International spectrum of\nschool education. These Focus Groups made general and specific comments in their\nrespective areas. Consequently, based on these reports of Focus Groups, National\nCurriculum Framework (NCF)-2005 was developed. NCERT designed the new syllabi and constituted Textbook Development Teams\nfor Classes XI and XII to prepare textbooks in mathematics under the new guidelines\nand new syllabi. The textbook for Class XI is already in use, which was brought in\n2005. The first draft of the present book (Class XII) was prepared by the team consisting\nof NCERT faculty, experts and practicing teachers. The draft was refined by the\ndevelopment team in different meetings. This draft of the book was exposed to a\ngroup of practicing teachers teaching mathematics at higher secondary stage in different\nparts of the country, in a review workshop organised by the NCERT at Delhi. The\nteachers made useful comments and suggestions which were incorporated in the draft\ntextbook. The draft textbook was finalised by an editorial board constituted out of the\ndevelopment team. Finally, the Advisory Group in Science and Mathematics and the\nMonitoring Committee constituted by the HRD Ministry, Government of India have\napproved the draft of the textbook. In the fitness of things, let us cite some of the essential features dominating the\ntextbook. These characteristics have reflections in almost all the chapters. The existing\ntextbook contain 13 main chapters and two appendices. Each Chapter contain the\nfollowings:\n§ Introduction: Highlighting the importance of the topic; connection with earlier\nstudied topics; brief mention about the new concepts to be discussed in the\nchapter. § Organisation of chapter into sections comprising one or more concepts/sub\nconcepts. § Motivating and introducing the concepts/sub concepts. Illustrations have been\nprovided wherever possible.", "Reprint 2025-26\nviii\n§ Proofs/problem solving involving deductive or inductive reasoning, multiplicity\nof approaches wherever possible have been inducted. § Geometric viewing/visualisation of concepts have been emphasised whenever\nneeded. § Applications of mathematical concepts have also been integrated with allied\nsubjects like science and social sciences. § Adequate and variety of examples/exercises have been given in each section. § For refocusing and strengthening the understanding and skill of problem solving\nand applicabilities, miscellaneous types of examples/exercises have been\nprovided involving two or more sub concepts at a time at the end of the chapter. The scope of challenging problems to talented minority have been reflected\nconducive to the recommendation as reflected in NCF-2005. § For more motivational purpose, brief historical background of topics have been\nprovided at the end of the chapter and at the beginning of each chapter relevant\nquotation and photograph of eminent mathematician who have contributed\nsignificantly in the development of the topic undertaken, are also provided. § Lastly, for direct recapitulation of main concepts, formulas and results, brief\nsummary of the chapter has also been provided. I am thankful to Professor Krishan Kumar, Director, NCERT who constituted the\nteam and invited me to join this national endeavor for the improvement of mathematics\neducation. He has provided us with an enlightened perspective and a very conducive\nenvironment. This made the task of preparing the book much more enjoyable and\nrewarding. I express my gratitude to Professor J.V. Narlikar, Chairperson of the\nAdvisory Group in Science and Mathematics, for his specific suggestions and advice\ntowards the improvement of the book from time to time. I, also, thank Prof. G. Ravindra,\nJoint Director, NCERT for his help from time to time. I express my sincere thanks to Professor Hukum Singh, Chief Coordinator and\nHead DESM, Dr. V. P. Singh, Coordinator and Professor S. K. Singh Gautam who\nhave been helping for the success of this project academically as well as\nadministratively. Also, I would like to place on records my appreciation and thanks to\nall the members of the team and the teachers who have been associated with this\nnoble cause in one or the other form. PAWAN K.
