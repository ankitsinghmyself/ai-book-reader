H. HARDY\n1.1 Introduction\nRecall that the notion of relations and functions, domain,\nco-domain and range have been introduced in Class XI\nalong with different types of specific real valued functions\nand their graphs. The concept of the term ‘relation’ in\nmathematics has been drawn from the meaning of relation\nin English language, according to which two objects or\nquantities are related if there is a recognisable connection\nor link between the two objects or quantities. Let A be\nthe set of students of Class XII of a school and B be the\nset of students of Class XI of the same school. Then some\nof the examples of relations from A to B are\n(i) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is brother of b},\nLejeune Dirichlet\n(ii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a is sister of b}, (1805-1859)\n(iii) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: age of a is greater than age of b},\n(iv) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: total marks obtained by a in the final examination is less than\nthe total marks obtained by b in the final examination},\n(v) {(a, b) ∈ A × B: a lives in the same locality as b}. However, abstracting from\nthis, we define mathematically a relation R from A to B as an arbitrary subset\nof A × B. If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b under the relation R and we write as\na R b. In general, (a, b) ∈ R, we do not bother whether there is a recognisable\nconnection or link between a and b. As seen in Class XI, functions are special kind of\nrelations. In this chapter, we will study different types of relations and functions, composition\nof functions, invertible functions and binary operations. Reprint 2025-26\n2 MATHEMATICS\n1.2 Types of Relations\nIn this section, we would like to study different types of relations. We know that a\nrelation in a set A is a subset of A × A. Thus, the empty set φ and A × A are two\nextreme relations. For illustration, consider a relation R in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4} given by\nR = {(a, b): a – b = 10}. This is the empty set, as no pair (a, b) satisfies the condition\na – b = 10. Similarly, R′ = {(a, b) : | a – b | ≥ 0} is the whole set A × A, as all pairs\n(a, b) in A × A satisfy | a – b | ≥ 0. These two extreme examples lead us to the\nfollowing definitions. Definition 1 A relation R in a set A is called empty relation, if no element of A is\nrelated to any element of A, i.e., R = φ ⊂ A × A. Definition 2 A relation R in a set A is called universal relation, if each element of A\nis related to every element of A, i.e., R = A × A. Both the empty relation and the universal relation are some times called trivial\nrelations. Example 1 Let A be the set of all students of a boys school.", "Show that the relation R\nin A given by R = {(a, b) : a is sister of b} is the empty relation and R′ = {(a, b) : the\ndifference between heights of a and b is less than 3 meters} is the universal relation. Solution Since the school is boys school, no student of the school can be sister of any\nstudent of the school. Hence, R = φ, showing that R is the empty relation. It is also\nobvious that the difference between heights of any two students of the school has to be\nless than 3 meters. This shows that R′ = A × A is the universal relation. Remark In Class XI, we have seen two ways of representing a relation, namely raster\nmethod and set builder method. However, a relation R in the set {1, 2, 3, 4} defined by R\n= {(a, b) : b = a + 1} is also expressed as a R b if and only if\nb = a + 1 by many authors. We may also use this notation, as and when convenient. If (a, b) ∈ R, we say that a is related to b and we denote it as a R b. One of the most important relation, which plays a significant role in Mathematics,\nis an equivalence relation. To study equivalence relation, we first consider three\ntypes of relations, namely reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Definition 3 A relation R in a set A is called\n(i) reflexive, if (a, a) ∈ R, for every a∈ A,\n(ii) symmetric, if (a , a ) ∈ R implies that (a , a )∈ R, for all a , a ∈ A. 1 2 2 1 1 2\n(iii) transitive, if (a , a ) ∈ R and (a , a )∈ R implies that (a , a )∈ R, for all a , a ,\n1 2 2 3 1 3 1 2\na ∈ A. 3\nReprint 2025-26\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 3\nDefinition 4 A relation R in a set A is said to be an equivalence relation if R is\nreflexive, symmetric and transitive. Example 2 Let T be the set of all triangles in a plane with R a relation in T given by\nR = {(T , T ) : T is congruent to T }. Show that R is an equivalence relation. 1 2 1 2\nSolution R is reflexive, since every triangle is congruent to itself. Further,\n(T , T ) ∈ R ⇒ T is congruent to T ⇒ T is congruent to T ⇒ (T , T ) ∈ R. Hence,\n1 2 1 2 2 1 2 1\nR is symmetric. Moreover, (T , T ), (T , T ) ∈ R ⇒ T is congruent to T and T is\n1 2 2 3 1 2 2\ncongruent to T ⇒ T is congruent to T ⇒ (T , T ) ∈ R. Therefore, R is an equivalence\n3 1 3 1 3\nrelation. Example 3 Let L be the set of all lines in a plane and R be the relation in L defined as\nR = {(L , L ) : L is perpendicular to L }. Show that R is symmetric but neither\n1 2 1 2\nreflexive nor transitive. Solution R is not reflexive, as a line L can not be perpendicular to itself, i.e., (L , L )\n1 1 1\n∉ R. R is symmetric as (L , L ) ∈ R\n1 2\n⇒ L is perpendicular to L\n1 2\n⇒ L is perpendicular to L\n2 1\n⇒ (L , L ) ∈ R. 2 1\nR is not transitive. Indeed, if L is perpendicular to L and\n1 2 Fig 1.1\nL is perpendicular to L , then L can never be perpendicular to\n2 3 1\nL . In fact, L is parallel to L , i.e., (L , L ) ∈ R, (L , L ) ∈ R but (L , L ) ∉ R. 3 1 3 1 2 2 3 1 3\nExample 4 Show that the relation R in the set {1, 2, 3} given by R = {(1, 1), (2, 2),\n(3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)} is reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.", "Solution R is reflexive, since (1, 1), (2, 2) and (3, 3) lie in R. Also, R is not symmetric,\nas (1, 2) ∈ R but (2, 1) ∉ R. Similarly, R is not transitive, as (1, 2) ∈ R and (2, 3) ∈ R\nbut (1, 3) ∉ R. Example 5 Show that the relation R in the set Z of integers given by\nR = {(a, b) : 2 divides a – b}\nis an equivalence relation. Solution R is reflexive, as 2 divides (a – a) for all a ∈ Z. Further, if (a, b) ∈ R, then\n2 divides a – b. Therefore, 2 divides b – a. Hence, (b, a) ∈ R, which shows that R is\nsymmetric. Similarly, if (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R, then a – b and b – c are divisible by\n2. Now, a – c = (a – b) + (b – c) is even (Why?). So, (a – c) is divisible by 2. This\nshows that R is transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation in Z. Reprint 2025-26\n4 MATHEMATICS\nIn Example 5, note that all even integers are related to zero, as (0, ± 2), (0, ± 4)\netc., lie in R and no odd integer is related to 0, as (0, ± 1), (0, ± 3) etc., do not lie in R. Similarly, all odd integers are related to one and no even integer is related to one. Therefore, the set E of all even integers and the set O of all odd integers are subsets of\nZ satisfying following conditions:\n(i) All elements of E are related to each other and all elements of O are related to\neach other. (ii) No element of E is related to any element of O and vice-versa. (iii) E and O are disjoint and Z = E ∪ O. The subset E is called the equivalence class containing zero and is denoted by\n[0]. Similarly, O is the equivalence class containing 1 and is denoted by [1]. Note that\n[0] ≠ [1], [0] = [2r] and [1] = [2r + 1], r ∈ Z. Infact, what we have seen above is true\nfor an arbitrary equivalence relation R in a set X. Given an arbitrary equivalence\nrelation R in an arbitrary set X, R divides X into mutually disjoint subsets A called\ni\npartitions or subdivisions of X satisfying:\n(i) all elements of A are related to each other, for all i. i\n(ii) no element of A is related to any element of A , i ≠ j. i j\n(iii) ∪ A = X and A ∩ A = φ, i ≠ j. j i j\nThe subsets A are called equivalence classes. The interesting part of the situation\ni\nis that we can go reverse also. For example, consider a subdivision of the set Z given\nby three mutually disjoint subsets A , A and A whose union is Z with\n1 2 3\nA = {x ∈ Z : x is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 6, – 3, 0, 3, 6, ...}\n1\nA = {x ∈ Z : x – 1 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 5, – 2, 1, 4, 7, ...}\n2\nA = {x ∈ Z : x – 2 is a multiple of 3} = {..., – 4, – 1, 2, 5, 8, ...}\n3\nDefine a relation R in Z given by R = {(a, b) : 3 divides a – b}. Following the\narguments similar to those used in Example 5, we can show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Also, A coincides with the set of all integers in Z which are related to zero, A\n1 2\ncoincides with the set of all integers which are related to 1 and A coincides with the\n3\nset of all integers in Z which are related to 2. Thus, A = [0], A = [1] and A = [2]. 1 2 3\nIn fact, A = [3r], A = [3r + 1] and A = [3r + 2], for all r ∈ Z.", "1 2 3\nExample 6 Let R be the relation defined in the set A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} by\nR = {(a, b) : both a and b are either odd or even}. Show that R is an equivalence\nrelation. Further, show that all the elements of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each\nother and all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to each other, but no\nelement of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} is related to any element of the subset {2, 4, 6}. Reprint 2025-26\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 5\nSolution Given any element a in A, both a and a must be either odd or even, so\nthat (a, a) ∈ R. Further, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ both a and b must be either odd or even\n⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ all elements a, b, c, must be\neither even or odd simultaneously ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R. Hence, R is an equivalence relation. Further, all the elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are related to each other, as all the elements\nof this subset are odd. Similarly, all the elements of the subset {2, 4, 6} are related to\neach other, as all of them are even. Also, no element of the subset {1, 3, 5, 7} can be\nrelated to any element of {2, 4, 6}, as elements of {1, 3, 5, 7} are odd, while elements\nof {2, 4, 6} are even. EXERCISE 1.1\n1.

Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two functions have also been\nstudied. As the concept of function is of paramount importance in mathematics and\namong other disciplines as well, we would like to extend our study about function from\nwhere we finished earlier.", "In this section, we would like to study different types of\nfunctions. Consider the functions f , f , f and f given by the following diagrams. 1 2 3 4\nIn Fig 1.2, we observe that the images of distinct elements of X under the function\n1\nf are distinct, but the image of two distinct elements 1 and 2 of X under f is same,\n1 1 2\nnamely b. Further, there are some elements like e and f in X which are not images of\n2\nany element of X under f , while all elements of X are images of some elements of X\n1 1 3 1\nunder f . The above observations lead to the following definitions:\n3\nDefinition 5 A function f : X → Y is defined to be one-one (or injective), if the images\nof distinct elements of X under f are distinct, i.e., for every x , x ∈ X, f(x ) = f(x )\n1 2 1 2\nimplies x = x . Otherwise, f is called many-one. 1 2\nThe function f and f in Fig 1.2 (i) and (iv) are one-one and the function f and f\n1 4 2 3\nin Fig 1.2 (ii) and (iii) are many-one. Definition 6 A function f : X → Y is said to be onto (or surjective), if every element\nof Y is the image of some element of X under f, i.e., for every y ∈ Y, there exists an\nelement x in X such that f(x) = y. The function f and f in Fig 1.2 (iii), (iv) are onto and the function f in Fig 1.2 (i) is\n3 4 1\nnot onto as elements e, f in X are not the image of any element in X under f . 2 1 1\nReprint 2025-26\n8 MATHEMATICS\nFig 1.2 (i) to (iv)\nRemark f : X → Y is onto if and only if Range of f = Y. Definition 7 A function f : X → Y is said to be one-one and onto (or bijective), if f is\nboth one-one and onto. The function f in Fig 1.2 (iv) is one-one and onto. 4\nExample 7 Let A be the set of all 50 students of Class X in a school. Let f : A → N be\nfunction defined by f(x) = roll number of the student x. Show that f is one-one\nbut not onto. Solution No two different students of the class can have same roll number. Therefore,\nf must be one-one. We can assume without any loss of generality that roll numbers of\nstudents are from 1 to 50. This implies that 51 in N is not roll number of any student of\nthe class, so that 51 can not be image of any element of X under f. Hence, f is not onto. Example 8 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(x) = 2x, is one-one but not\nonto. Solution The function f is one-one, for f(x ) = f(x ) ⇒ 2x = 2x ⇒ x = x . Further,\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nf is not onto, as for 1 ∈ N, there does not exist any x in N such that f(x) = 2x = 1. Reprint 2025-26\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 9\nExample 9 Prove that the function f : R → R, given by f(x) = 2x, is one-one and onto. Solution f is one-one, as f(x ) = f(x ) ⇒ 2x = 2x ⇒ x = x . Also, given any real\n1 2 1 2 1 2\ny y y\nnumber y in R, there exists in R such that f( ) = 2 . ( ) = y. Hence, f is onto. 2 2 2\nFig 1.3\nExample 10 Show that the function f : N → N, given by f(1) = f(2) = 1 and f(x) = x – 1,\nfor every x > 2, is onto but not one-one. Solution f is not one-one, as f(1) = f(2) = 1.", "But f is onto, as given any y ∈ N, y ≠ 1,\nwe can choose x as y + 1 such that f(y + 1) = y + 1 – 1 = y. Also for 1 ∈ N, we\nhave f(1) = 1. Example 11 Show that the function f : R → R,\ndefined as f(x) = x2, is neither one-one nor onto. Solution Since f(– 1) = 1 = f(1), f is not one-\none. Also, the element – 2 in the co-domain R is\nnot image of any element x in the domain R\n(Why?). Therefore f is not onto. Example 12 Show that f : N → N, given by\nx+1,if xisodd,\nf(x)=\nx- 1,if xiseven\nis both one-one and onto. Fig 1.4\nReprint 2025-26\n10 MATHEMATICS\nSolution Suppose f(x ) = f(x ). Note that if x is odd and x is even, then we will have\n1 2 1 2\nx + 1 = x – 1, i.e., x – x = 2 which is impossible. Similarly, the possibility of x being\n1 2 2 1 1\neven and x being odd can also be ruled out, using the similar argument. Therefore,\n2\nboth x and x must be either odd or even. Suppose both x and x are odd. Then\n1 2 1 2\nf(x ) = f(x ) ⇒ x + 1 = x + 1 ⇒ x = x . Similarly, if both x and x are even, then also\n1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2\nf(x ) = f(x ) ⇒ x – 1 = x – 1 ⇒ x = x . Thus, f is one-one. Also, any odd number\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n2r + 1 in the co-domain N is the image of 2r + 2 in the domain N and any even number\n2r in the co-domain N is the image of 2r – 1 in the domain N. Thus, f is onto. Example 13 Show that an onto function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} is always one-one. Solution Suppose f is not one-one. Then there exists two elements, say 1 and 2 in the\ndomain whose image in the co-domain is same. Also, the image of 3 under f can be\nonly one element. Therefore, the range set can have at the most two elements of the\nco-domain {1, 2, 3}, showing that f is not onto, a contradiction. Hence, f must be one-one. Example 14 Show that a one-one function f : {1, 2, 3} → {1, 2, 3} must be onto. Solution Since f is one-one, three elements of {1, 2, 3} must be taken to 3 different\nelements of the co-domain {1, 2, 3} under f. Hence, f has to be onto. Remark The results mentioned in Examples 13 and 14 are also true for an arbitrary\nfinite set X, i.e., a one-one function f : X → X is necessarily onto and an onto map\nf : X → X is necessarily one-one, for every finite set X. In contrast to this, Examples 8\nand 10 show that for an infinite set, this may not be true. In fact, this is a characteristic\ndifference between a finite and an infinite set. EXERCISE 1.2\n1\n1.

Fig 1.5\nExample 15 Let f : {2, 3, 4, 5} → {3, 4, 5, 9} and g : {3, 4, 5, 9} → {7, 11, 15} be\nfunctions defined as f(2) = 3, f(3) = 4, f(4) = f(5) = 5 and g(3) = g(4) = 7 and\ng(5) = g(9) = 11. Find gof. Solution We have gof(2) = g(f(2)) = g(3) = 7, gof(3) = g(f(3)) = g(4) = 7,\ngof(4) = g(f(4)) = g(5) = 11 and gof(5) = g(5) = 11. Example 16 Find gof and fog, if f : R → R and g : R → R are given by f(x) = cos x\nand g(x) = 3x2. Show that gof ≠ fog. Solution We have gof(x) = g(f(x)) = g(cos x) = 3 (cos x)2 = 3 cos2 x. Similarly,\nfog(x) = f(g(x)) = f(3x2) = cos (3x2). Note that 3cos2 x ≠ cos 3x2, for x = 0. Hence,\ngof ≠ fog. Definition 9 A function f : X → Y is defined to be invertible, if there exists a function\ng : Y → X such that gof = I and fog = I . The function g is called the inverse of f and\nX Y\nis denoted by f–1. Thus, if f is invertible, then f must be one-one and onto and conversely, if f is\none-one and onto, then f must be invertible. This fact significantly helps for proving a\nfunction f to be invertible by showing that f is one-one and onto, specially when the\nactual inverse of f is not to be determined.", "Example 17 Let f : N → Y be a function defined as f(x) = 4x + 3, where,\nY = {y ∈ N: y = 4x + 3 for some x ∈ N}. Show that f is invertible. Find the inverse. Solution Consider an arbitrary element y of Y. By the definition of Y, y = 4x + 3,\n(y−3)\nfor some x in the domain N. This shows that x= .

Y\nMiscellaneous Examples\nExample 18 If R and R are equivalence relations in a set A, show that R ∩ R is\n1 2 1 2\nalso an equivalence relation. Solution Since R and R are equivalence relations, (a, a) ∈ R, and (a, a) ∈ R ∀a ∈ A. 1 2 1 2\nThis implies that (a, a) ∈ R ∩ R , ∀a, showing R ∩ R is reflexive. Further,\n1 2 1 2\n(a, b) ∈ R ∩ R ⇒ (a, b) ∈ R and (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R and (b, a) ∈ R ⇒\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n(b, a) ∈ R ∩ R , hence, R ∩ R is symmetric. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R ∩ R and\n1 2 1 2 1 2\n(b, c) ∈ R ∩ R ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R and (a, c) ∈ R ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R ∩ R. This shows that\n1 2 1 2 1 2\nR ∩ R is transitive. Thus, R ∩ R is an equivalence relation. 1 2 1 2\nExample 19 Let R be a relation on the set A of ordered pairs of positive integers\ndefined by (x, y) R (u, v) if and only if xv = yu. Show that R is an equivalence relation. Solution Clearly, (x, y) R (x, y), ∀(x, y) ∈ A, since xy = yx. This shows that R is\nreflexive. Further, (x, y) R (u, v) ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ uy = vx and hence (u, v) R (x, y). This\nshows that R is symmetric. Similarly, (x, y) R (u, v) and (u, v) R (a, b) ⇒ xv = yu and\na a b a\nub = va ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ xv = yu ⇒ xb = ya and hence (x, y) R (a, b). Thus, R\nu u v u\nis transitive. Thus, R is an equivalence relation. Example 20 Let X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Let R be a relation in X given\n1\nby R = {(x, y) : x – y is divisible by 3} and R be another relation on X given by\n1 2\nR = {(x, y): {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7}} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9}}. Show that\n2\nR = R . 1 2\nSolution Note that the characteristic of sets {1, 4, 7}, {2, 5, 8} and {3, 6, 9} is\nthat difference between any two elements of these sets is a multiple of 3. Therefore,\n(x, y) ∈ R ⇒ x – y is a multiple of 3 ⇒ {x, y} ⊂ {1, 4, 7} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8}\n1\nor {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ (x, y) ∈ R . Hence, R ⊂ R . Similarly, {x, y} ∈ R ⇒ {x, y}\n2 1 2 2\nReprint 2025-26\n14 MATHEMATICS\n⊂ {1, 4, 7} or {x, y} ⊂ {2, 5, 8} or {x, y} ⊂ {3, 6, 9} ⇒ x – y is divisible by\n3 ⇒ {x, y} ∈ R . This shows that R ⊂ R . Hence, R = R . 1 2 1 1 2\nExample 21 Let f : X → Y be a function. Define a relation R in X given by\nR = {(a, b): f(a) = f(b)}. Examine whether R is an equivalence relation or not. Solution For every a ∈ X, (a, a) ∈ R, since f(a) = f(a), showing that R is reflexive. Similarly, (a, b) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) ⇒ f(b) = f(a) ⇒ (b, a) ∈ R. Therefore, R is\nsymmetric.", "Further, (a, b) ∈ R and (b, c) ∈ R ⇒ f(a) = f(b) and f(b) = f(c) ⇒ f(a)\n= f(c) ⇒ (a, c) ∈ R, which implies that R is transitive. Hence, R is an equivalence\nrelation. Example 22 Find the number of all one-one functions from set A = {1, 2, 3} to itself. Solution One-one function from {1, 2, 3} to itself is simply a permutation on three\nsymbols 1, 2, 3. Therefore, total number of one-one maps from {1, 2, 3} to itself is\nsame as total number of permutations on three symbols 1, 2, 3 which is 3! = 6. Example 23 Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Then show that the number of relations containing (1, 2)\nand (2, 3) which are reflexive and transitive but not symmetric is three. Solution The smallest relation R containing (1, 2) and (2, 3) which is reflexive and\n1\ntransitive but not symmetric is {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)}. Now, if we add\nthe pair (2, 1) to R to get R , then the relation R will be reflexive, transitive but not\n1 2 2\nsymmetric. Similarly, we can obtain R by adding (3, 2) to R to get the desired relation. 3 1\nHowever, we can not add two pairs (2, 1), (3, 2) or single pair (3, 1) to R at a time, as\n1\nby doing so, we will be forced to add the remaining pair in order to maintain transitivity\nand in the process, the relation will become symmetric also which is not required. Thus,\nthe total number of desired relations is three. Example 24 Show that the number of equivalence relation in the set {1, 2, 3} containing\n(1, 2) and (2, 1) is two. Solution The smallest equivalence relation R containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is {(1, 1),\n1\n(2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1)}. Now we are left with only 4 pairs namely (2, 3), (3, 2),\n(1, 3) and (3, 1). If we add any one, say (2, 3) to R , then for symmetry we must add\n1\n(3, 2) also and now for transitivity we are forced to add (1, 3) and (3, 1). Thus, the only\nequivalence relation bigger than R is the universal relation. This shows that the total\n1\nnumber of equivalence relations containing (1, 2) and (2, 1) is two. Example 25 Consider the identity function I : N → N defined as I (x) = x ∀x ∈ N. N N\nShow that although I is onto but I + I : N → N defined as\nN N N\n(I + I ) (x) = I (x) + I (x) = x + x = 2x is not onto. N N N N\nReprint 2025-26\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 15\nSolution Clearly I is onto. But I + I is not onto, as we can find an element 3\nN N N\nin the co-domain N such that there does not exist any x in the domain N with\n(I + I ) (x) = 2x = 3.

This is the characteristic property of a\nfinite set. This is not true for infinite set\nReprint 2025-26\nRELATIONS AND FUNCTIONS 17\nHistorical Note\nThe concept of function has evolved over a long period of time starting from\nR. Descartes (1596-1650), who used the word ‘function’ in his manuscript\n“Geometrie” in 1637 to mean some positive integral power xn of a variable x\nwhile studying geometrical curves like hyperbola, parabola and ellipse. James\nGregory (1636-1675) in his work “ Vera Circuli et Hyperbolae Quadratura”\n(1667) considered function as a quantity obtained from other quantities by\nsuccessive use of algebraic operations or by any other operations.", "Later G. W. Leibnitz (1646-1716) in his manuscript “Methodus tangentium inversa, seu de\nfunctionibus” written in 1673 used the word ‘function’ to mean a quantity varying\nfrom point to point on a curve such as the coordinates of a point on the curve, the\nslope of the curve, the tangent and the normal to the curve at a point. However,\nin his manuscript “Historia” (1714), Leibnitz used the word ‘function’ to mean\nquantities that depend on a variable. He was the first to use the phrase ‘function\nof x’. John Bernoulli (1667-1748) used the notation φx for the first time in 1718 to\nindicate a function of x. But the general adoption of symbols like f, F, φ, ψ ... to\nrepresent functions was made by Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) in 1734 in the first\npart of his manuscript “Analysis Infinitorium”. Later on, Joeph Louis Lagrange\n(1736-1813) published his manuscripts “Theorie des functions analytiques” in\n1793, where he discussed about analytic function and used the notion f(x), F(x),\nφ(x) etc. for different function of x. Subsequently, Lejeunne Dirichlet\n(1805-1859) gave the definition of function which was being used till the set\ntheoretic definition of function presently used, was given after set theory was\ndeveloped by Georg Cantor (1845-1918). The set theoretic definition of function\nknown to us presently is simply an abstraction of the definition given by Dirichlet\nin a rigorous manner. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
