["Chapter Nine\nRAY OPTICS\nAND OPTICAL\nINSTRUMENTS\n9.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nNature has endowed the human eye (retina) with the sensitivity to detect\nelectromagnetic waves within a small range of the electromagnetic\nspectrum. Electromagnetic radiation belonging to this region of the\nspectrum (wavelength of about 400 nm to 750 nm) is called light. It is\nmainly through light and the sense of vision that we know and interpret\nthe world around us. There are two things that we can intuitively mention about light from\ncommon experience. First, that it travels with enormous speed and second,\nthat it travels in a straight line. It took some time for people to realise that\nthe speed of light is finite and measurable. Its presently accepted value\nin vacuum is c = 2.99792458 × 108 m s–1. For many purposes, it suffices\nto take c = 3 × 108 m s–1. The speed of light in vacuum is the highest\nspeed attainable in nature. The intuitive notion that light travels in a straight line seems to\ncontradict what we have learnt in Chapter 8, that light is an\nelectromagnetic wave of wavelength belonging to the visible part of the\nspectrum. How to reconcile the two facts? The answer is that the\nwavelength of light is very small compared to the size of ordinary objects\nthat we encounter commonly (generally of the order of a few cm or larger). In this situation, as you will learn in Chapter 10, a light wave can be\nconsidered to travel from one point to another, along a straight line joining\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nthem. The path is called a ray of light, and a bundle of such rays\nconstitutes a beam of light. In this chapter, we consider the phenomena of reflection, refraction\nand dispersion of light, using the ray picture of light. Using the basic\nlaws of reflection and refraction, we shall study the image formation by\nplane and spherical reflecting and refracting surfaces. We then go on to\ndescribe the construction and working of some important optical\ninstruments, including the human eye. 9.2 R L S M\nEFLECTION OF IGHT BY PHERICAL IRRORS\nWe are familiar with the laws of reflection. The\nangle of reflection (i.e., the angle between reflected\nray and the normal to the reflecting surface or\nthe mirror) equals the angle of incidence (angle\nbetween incident ray and the normal). Also that\nthe incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to\nthe reflecting surface at the point of incidence lie\nin the same plane (Fig. 9.1). These laws are valid\nat each point on any reflecting surface whether\nplane or curved. However, we shall restrict our\ndiscussion to the special case of curved surfaces,\nFIGURE 9.1 The incident ray, reflected ray that is, spherical surfaces. The normal in this case\nand the normal to the reflecting surface lie is to be taken as normal to the tangent to surface\nin the same plane. at the point of incidence. That is, the normal is\nalong the radius, the line joining the centre of curvature of the mirror to\nthe point of incidence.", "We have already studied that the geometric centre of a spherical mirror\nis called its pole while that of a spherical lens is called its optical centre. The line joining the pole and the centre of curvature of the spherical\nmirror is known as the principal axis. In the case of spherical lenses, the\nprincipal axis is the line joining the optical centre with its principal focus\nas you will see later. 9.2.1 Sign convention\nTo derive the relevant formulae for\nreflection by spherical mirrors and\nrefraction by spherical lenses, we must\nfirst adopt a sign convention for\nmeasuring distances. In this book, we\nshall follow the Cartesian sign\nconvention. According to this\nconvention, all distances are measured\nfrom the pole of the mirror or the optical\ncentre of the lens. The distances\nmeasured in the same direction as the\nincident light are taken as positive and\nFIGURE 9.2 The Cartesian Sign Convention. those measured in the direction\nopposite to the direction of incident light are taken as negative (Fig. 9.2). 222 The heights measured upwards with respect to x-axis and normal to the\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nprincipal axis (x-axis) of the mirror/lens are taken as positive (Fig. 9.2). The heights measured downwards are taken as negative. With a common accepted convention, it turns out that a single formula\nfor spherical mirrors and a single formula for spherical lenses can handle\nall different cases. 9.2.2 Focal length of spherical mirrors\nFigure 9.3 shows what happens when a parallel beam of light is incident\non (a) a concave mirror, and (b) a convex mirror. We assume that the rays\nare paraxial, i.e., they are incident at points close to the pole P of the mirror\nand make small angles with the principal axis. The reflected rays converge\nat a point F on the principal axis of a concave mirror [Fig. 9.3(a)]. For a convex mirror, the reflected rays appear to diverge from a point F\non its principal axis [Fig. 9.3(b)]. The point F is called the principal focus\nof the mirror. If the parallel paraxial beam of light were incident, making\nsome angle with the principal axis, the reflected rays would converge (or\nappear to diverge) from a point in a plane through F normal to the principal\naxis. This is called the focal plane of the mirror [Fig. 9.3(c)]. FIGURE 9.3 Focus of a concave and convex mirror. The distance between the focus F and the pole P of the mirror is called\nthe focal length of the mirror, denoted by f. We now show that f = R/2,\nwhere R is the radius of curvature of the mirror. The geometry of reflection\nof an incident ray is shown in Fig. 9.4. Let C be the centre of curvature of the mirror. Consider a ray parallel\nto the principal axis striking the mirror at M. Then CM will be\nperpendicular to the mirror at M. Let q be the angle of incidence, and MD 223\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nbe the perpendicular from M on the principal axis.", "Then,\n—MCP = q and —MFP = 2q\nNow,\nMD MD\ntanq = and tan 2q = (9.1)\nCD FD\nFor small q, which is true for paraxial rays, tanq » q,\ntan 2q » 2q. Therefore, Eq. (9.1) gives\nMD MD\n= 2\nFD CD\nCD\nor, FD = (9.2)\n2\nNow, for small q, the point D is very close to the point P. Therefore, FD = f and CD = R. Equation (9.2) then gives\nf = R/2 (9.3)\n9.2.3 The mirror equation\nIf rays emanating from a point actually meet at another point\nFIGURE 9.4 Geometry of\nafter reflection and/or refraction, that point is called the image\nreflection of an incident ray on\nof the first point. The image is real if the rays actually converge\n(a) concave spherical mirror,\nto the point; it is virtual if the rays do not actually meet but\nand (b) convex spherical mirror. appear to diverge from the point when produced\nbackwards. An image is thus a point-to-point\ncorrespondence with the object established through\nreflection and/or refraction. In principle, we can take any two rays emanating\nfrom a point on an object, trace their paths, find their\npoint of intersection and thus, obtain the image of\nthe point due to reflection at a spherical mirror. In\npractice, however, it is convenient to choose any two\nof the following rays:\n(i) The ray from the point which is parallel to the\nprincipal axis. The reflected ray goes through\nthe focus of the mirror. (ii) The ray passing through the centre of\ncurvature of a concave mirror or appearing to\nFIGURE 9.5 Ray diagram for image\npass through it for a convex mirror. The\nformation by a concave mirror. reflected ray simply retraces the path. (iii) The ray passing through (or directed towards) the focus of the concave\nmirror or appearing to pass through (or directed towards) the focus\nof a convex mirror. The reflected ray is parallel to the principal axis. (iv) The ray incident at any angle at the pole. The reflected ray follows\nlaws of reflection. Figure 9.5 shows the ray diagram considering three rays. It shows\nthe image A¢B¢ (in this case, real) of an object AB formed by a concave\nmirror. It does not mean that only three rays emanate from the point A. An infinite number of rays emanate from any source, in all directions. Thus, point A¢ is image point of A if every ray originating at point A and\n224 falling on the concave mirror after reflection passes through the point A¢. Reprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nWe now derive the mirror equation or the relation between the object\ndistance (u), image distance (v) and the focal length (f ). From Fig. 9.5, the two right-angled triangles A¢B¢F and MPF are\nsimilar. (For paraxial rays, MP can be considered to be a straight line\nperpendicular to CP.) Therefore,\nB¢A¢ B¢ F\n=\nPM FP\nB¢A¢ B¢ F\n=\nor (∵PM = AB) (9.4)\nBA FP\nSince — APB = — A¢PB¢, the right angled triangles A¢B¢P and ABP are\nalso similar. Therefore,\nB¢A¢ B¢ P\n=\n(9.5)\nBA BP\nComparing Eqs. (9.4) and (9.5), we get\nB¢F B¢P–FP B¢P\n= =\n(9.6)\nFP FP BP\nEquation (9.6) is a relation involving magnitude of distances.", "We now\napply the sign convention. We note that light travels from the object to\nthe mirror MPN. Hence this is taken as the positive direction. To reach\nthe object AB, image A¢B¢ as well as the focus F from the pole P, we have\nto travel opposite to the direction of incident light. Hence, all the three\nwill have negative signs. Thus,\nB¢ P = –v, FP = –f, BP = –u\nUsing these in Eq. (9.6), we get\n–v+ f –v\n=\n– f –u\nv– f v\nor =\nf u\nv v\n=1+\nf u\nDividing it by v, we get\n1 1 1\n+ =\nv u f (9.7)\nThis relation is known as the mirror equation. The size of the image relative to the size of the object is another\nimportant quantity to consider. We define linear magnification (m) as the\nratio of the height of the image (h¢) to the height of the object (h):\nh¢\nm = (9.8)\nh\nh and h¢ will be taken positive or negative in accordance with the accepted\nsign convention. In triangles A¢B¢P and ABP, we have,\nB¢A¢ B¢ P\n=\nBA BP\nWith the sign convention, this becomes\n225\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\n–h¢ –v\n=\nh –u\nso that\nh¢ v\nm = = – (9.9)\nh u\nWe have derived here the mirror equation, Eq. (9.7), and the\nmagnification formula, Eq. (9.9), for the case of real, inverted image formed\nby a concave mirror. With the proper use of sign convention, these are,\nin fact, valid for all the cases of reflection by a spherical mirror (concave\nor convex) whether the image formed is real or virtual. Figure 9.6 shows\nthe ray diagrams for virtual image formed by a concave and convex mirror. You should verify that Eqs. (9.7) and (9.9) are valid for these cases as\nwell. FIGURE 9.6 Image formation by (a) a concave mirror with object between\nP and F, and (b) a convex mirror. Example 9.1 Suppose that the lower half of the concave mirror’s\nreflecting surface in Fig. 9.6 is covered with an opaque (non-reflective)\nmaterial. What effect will this have on the image of an object placed\nin front of the mirror? 1.9\nSolution You may think that the image will now show only half of the\nELPMAXE object, but taking the laws of reflection to be true for all points of the\nremaining part of the mirror, the image will be that of the whole object. However, as the area of the reflecting surface has been reduced, the\nintensity of the image will be low (in this case, half). Example 9.2 A mobile phone lies along the principal axis of a concave\nmirror, as shown in Fig. 9.7. Show by suitable diagram, the formation\nof its image. Explain why the magnification is not uniform. Will the\ndistortion of image depend on the location of the phone with respect\nto the mirror? 2.9\nELPMAXE\n226 FIGURE 9.7\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nSolution EXAMPLE\nThe ray diagram for the formation of the image of the phone is shown\nin Fig. 9.7. The image of the part which is on the plane perpendicular\nto principal axis will be on the same plane. It will be of the same size,\ni.e., B¢C = BC. You can yourself realise why the image is distorted.", "9.2\nExample 9.3 An object is placed at (i) 10 cm, (ii) 5 cm in front of a\nconcave mirror of radius of curvature 15 cm.

This phenomenon can be noticed by any person\nsitting in a stationary car or a bus. In case of moving vehicles, a\nsimilar phenomenon could be observed if the vehicle in the rear is\nmoving closer with a constant speed. 9.3 R\nEFRACTION\nWhen a beam of light encounters another transparent medium, a part of\nlight gets reflected back into the first medium while the rest enters the\nother. A ray of light represents a beam. The direction of propagation of an\nobliquely incident (0°< i < 90°) ray of light that enters the other medium,\nchanges at the interface of the two media. This phenomenon is called\nrefraction of light. Snell experimentally obtained the following laws\nof refraction:\n(i) The incident ray, the refracted ray and the\nnormal to the interface at the point of\nincidence, all lie in the same plane. (ii) The ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence\nto the sine of angle of refraction is constant.", "Remember that the angles of incidence (i ) and\nrefraction (r ) are the angles that the incident\nand its refracted ray make with the normal,\nrespectively. We have\nsini\n=n\n(9.10)\nsinr 21\nwhere n is a constant, called the refractive\n21\nindex of the second medium with respect to the\nFIGURE 9.8 Refraction and reflection of light. first medium. Equation (9.10) is the well-known\nSnell’s law of refraction. We note that n is a\n21\ncharacteristic of the pair of media (and also depends on the wavelength\nof light), but is independent of the angle of incidence. From Eq. (9.10), if n > 1, r < i, i.e., the refracted ray bends towards\n21\nthe normal. In such a case medium 2 is said to be optically denser (or\n228 denser, in short) than medium 1. On the other hand, if n <1, r > i, the\n21\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nrefracted ray bends away from the normal. This\nis the case when incident ray in a denser\nmedium refracts into a rarer medium. Note: Optical density should not be\nconfused with mass density, which is mass\nper unit volume. It is possible that mass\ndensity of an optically denser medium may\nbe less than that of an optically rarer\nmedium (optical density is the ratio of the\nspeed of light in two media). For example, FIGURE 9.9 Lateral shift of a ray refracted\nturpentine and water. Mass density of through a parallel-sided slab. turpentine is less than that of water but\nits optical density is higher. If n is the refractive index of medium 2 with\n21\nrespect to medium 1 and n the refractive index\n12\nof medium 1 with respect to medium 2, then it\nshould be clear that\n1\nn =\n12 n (9.11)\n21\nIt also follows that if n is the refractive index\n32\nof medium 3 with respect to medium 2 then n =\n32\nn × n , where n is the refractive index of\n31 12 31\nmedium 3 with respect to medium 1. Some elementary results based on the laws of\nrefraction follow immediately. For a rectangular\nslab, refraction takes place at two interfaces (air-\nglass and glass-air). It is easily seen from Fig. 9.9\nthat r = i , i.e., the emergent ray is parallel to the\n2 1\nincident ray—there is no deviation, but it does\nsuffer lateral displacement/shift with respect to the\nincident ray. Another familiar observation is that FIGURE 9.10 Apparent depth for\nthe bottom of a tank filled with water appears to be (a) normal, and (b) oblique viewing. raised (Fig. 9.10). For viewing near the normal direction, it can be shown\nthat the apparent depth (h ) is real depth (h ) divided by the refractive\n1 2\nindex of the medium (water). 9.4 T I R\nOTAL NTERNAL EFLECTION\nWhen light travels from an optically denser medium to a rarer medium\nat the interface, it is partly reflected back into the same medium and\npartly refracted to the second medium. This reflection is called the internal\nreflection. When a ray of light enters from a denser medium to a rarer medium,\nit bends away from the normal, for example, the ray AO B in Fig. 9.11.", "1\nThe incident ray AO is partially reflected (OC) and partially transmitted\n1 1\n(OB) or refracted, the angle of refraction (r) being larger than the angle of\n1 229\nincidence (i). As the angle of incidence increases, so does the angle of\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nrefraction, till for the ray AO, the angle of\n3\nrefraction is p/2. The refracted ray is bent\nso much away from the normal that it\ngrazes the surface at the interface between\nthe two media. This is shown by the ray\nAO D in Fig. 9.11. If the angle of incidence\n3\nis increased still further (e.g., the ray AO),\n4\nrefraction is not possible, and the incident\nray is totally reflected. This is called total\ninternal reflection. When light gets\nreflected by a surface, normally some\nfraction of it gets transmitted. The\nFIGURE 9.11 Refraction and internal reflection\nof rays from a point A in the denser medium reflected ray, therefore, is always less\n(water) incident at different angles at the interface intense than the incident ray, howsoever\nwith a rarer medium (air). smooth the reflecting surface may be. In\ntotal internal reflection, on the other hand,\nno transmission of light takes place. The angle of incidence corresponding to an angle of refraction 90°,\nsay —AO N, is called the critical angle (i ) for the given pair of media. We\n3 c\nsee from Snell’s law [Eq. (9.10)] that if the relative refractive index of the\nrefracting medium is less than one then, since the maximum value of sin\nr is unity, there is an upper limit to the value of sin i for which the law\ncan be satisfied, that is, i = i such that\nc\nsin i = n (9.12)\nc 21\nFor values of i larger than i , Snell’s law of refraction cannot be\nc\nsatisfied, and hence no refraction is possible. The refractive index of denser medium 1 with respect to rarer medium\n2 will be n = 1/sini .

Do you find that it undergoes partial\nreflection (which is seen as a spot on the table below) and partial refraction\n[which comes out in the air and is seen as a spot on the roof; Fig. 9.12(a)]?", "Now direct the laser beam from one side of the beaker such that it strikes\nthe upper surface of water more obliquely [Fig. 9.12(b)]. Adjust the\ndirection of laser beam until you find the angle for which the refraction\nabove the water surface is totally absent and the beam is totally reflected\nback to water. This is total internal reflection at its simplest. Pour this water in a long test tube and shine the laser light from top,\nas shown in Fig. 9.12(c). Adjust the direction of the laser beam such that\nit is totally internally reflected every time it strikes the walls of the tube. This is similar to what happens in optical fibres.

(Compare with\nwhat you expect for a block of ordinary window glass 1 km thick.)\n9.5 R S S\nEFRACTION AT PHERICAL URFACES\nL\nAND BY ENSES\nWe have so far considered refraction at a plane interface. We shall now\nconsider refraction at a spherical interface between two transparent media. An infinitesimal part of a spherical surface can be regarded as planar\nand the same laws of refraction can be applied at every point on the\nsurface. Just as for reflection by a spherical mirror, the normal at the\npoint of incidence is perpendicular to the tangent plane to the spherical\nsurface at that point and, therefore, passes through its centre of\ncurvature. We first consider refraction by a single spherical surface and\nfollow it by thin lenses. A thin lens is a transparent optical medium\nbounded by two surfaces; at least one of which should be spherical. Applying the formula for image formation by a single spherical surface\nsuccessively at the two surfaces of a lens, we shall obtain the lens maker’s\nformula and then the lens formula. 9.5.1 Refraction at a spherical surface\nFigure 9.15 shows the geometry of formation of image I of an object O on\nthe principal axis of a spherical surface with centre of curvature C, and\nradius of curvature R. The rays are incident from a medium of refractive\nindex n , to another of refractive index n . As before, we take the aperture\n1 2\n(or the lateral size) of the surface to be small compared to other distances\ninvolved, so that small angle approximation can be made. In particular,\nNM will be taken to be nearly equal to the length of the perpendicular\nfrom the point N on the principal axis.", "We have, for small angles,\nMN\n232 tan —NOM =\nOM\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nMN\ntan —NCM =\nMC\nMN\ntan —NIM =\nMI\nNow, for DNOC, i is the exterior angle.

Though we derived\nit for a real image formed by a convex lens, the formula is valid for both\nconvex as well as concave lenses and for both real and virtual images. It is worth mentioning that the two foci, F and F¢, of a double convex\nor concave lens are equidistant from the optical centre. The focus on the\nside of the (original) source of light is called the first focal point, whereas\nthe other is called the second focal point. To find the image of an object by a lens, we can, in principle, take any\ntwo rays emanating from a point on an object; trace their paths using the\nlaws of refraction and find the point where the refracted rays meet (or\nappear to meet). In practice, however, it is convenient to choose any two\nof the following rays:\n(i) A ray emanating from the object parallel to the principal axis of the\nlens after refraction passes through the second principal focus F¢ (in\na convex lens) or appears to diverge (in a concave lens) from the first\nprincipal focus F. (ii) A ray of light, passing through the optical\ncentre of the lens, emerges without any\ndeviation after refraction. (iii) (a) A ray of light passing through the first\nprincipal focus of a convex lens [Fig. 9.17(a)]\nemerges parallel to the principal axis after\nrefraction. (b) A ray of light incident on a concave lens\nappearing to meet the principal axis at\nsecond focus point emerges parallel to the\nprincipal axis after refraction [Fig. 9.17(b)]. Figures 9.17(a) and (b) illustrate these rules\nfor a convex and a concave lens, respectively. You should practice drawing similar ray\ndiagrams for different positions of the object with\nrespect to the lens and also verify that the lens\nformula, Eq. (9.23), holds good for all cases. Here again it must be remembered that each\npoint on an object gives out infinite number of\nrays. All these rays will pass through the same\nimage point after refraction at the lens.

Example 9.6 A magician during a show makes a glass lens with\nn = 1.47 disappear in a trough of liquid. What is the refractive index\nof the liquid? Could the liquid be water? 6.9\nSolution\nThe refractive index of the liquid must be equal to 1.47 in order to\nELPMAXE\nmake the lens disappear. This means n = n . This gives 1/f =0 or\n1 2\nf fi ¥. The lens in the liquid will act like a plane sheet of glass. No,\nthe liquid is not water. It could be glycerine. 9.5.3 Power of a lens\nPower of a lens is a measure of the convergence or\ndivergence, which a lens introduces in the light falling on\nit. Clearly, a lens of shorter focal length bends the incident\nlight more, while converging it in case of a convex lens\nand diverging it in case of a concave lens. The power P of\na lens is defined as the tangent of the angle by which it\nconverges or diverges a beam of light parallel to the\nprincipal axis falling at unit distance from the optical\ncentre (Fig. 9.18). FIGURE 9.18 Power of a lens. h 1 1\ntanδ= ; ifh =1, tanδ= or d = for small\nf f f\nvalue of d. Thus,\n1\nP = (9.25)\nf\nThe SI unit for power of a lens is dioptre (D): 1D = 1m–1. The power of\na lens of focal length of 1 metre is one dioptre. Power of a lens is positive\nfor a converging lens and negative for a diverging lens. Thus, when an\noptician prescribes a corrective lens of power + 2.5 D, the required lens is\na convex lens of focal length + 40 cm. A lens of power of – 4.0 D means a\nconcave lens of focal length – 25 cm. Example 9.7 (i) If f = 0.5 m for a glass lens, what is the power of the\n7.9\nlens?

(ii) Here, we have f = +12 cm, R = +10 cm, R = –15 cm. 1 2\nRefractive index of air is taken as unity. We use the lens formula of Eq. (9.22).

(9.32) is an algebraic sum of individual powers, so some of the terms\non the right side may be positive (for convex lenses) and some negative\n(for concave lenses). Combination of lenses helps to obtain diverging or\nconverging lenses of desired magnification. It also enhances sharpness\nof the image. Since the image formed by the first lens becomes the object\nfor the second, Eq.

The angles of incidence\nand refraction at the first face AB are i and r ,\n1\nwhile the angle of incidence (from glass to air) at\nthe second face AC is r and the angle of refraction\n2\nor emergence e. The angle between the emergent\nray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ\nis called the angle of deviation, d. In the quadrilateral AQNR, two of the angles\n(at the vertices Q and R) are right angles. Therefore, the sum of the other angles of the\nquadrilateral is 180°. FIGURE 9.21 A ray of light passing through\na triangular glass prism. —A + —QNR = 180°\nFrom the triangle QNR,\nr + r + —QNR = 180°\n1 2\nComparing these two equations, we get\nr + r = A (9.34)\n1 2\nThe total deviation d is the sum of deviations at the two faces,\nd = (i – r ) + (e – r )\n1 2\nthat is,\nd = i + e – A (9.35)\nThus, the angle of deviation depends on the angle of incidence. A plot\nbetween the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in\nFig. 9.22. You can see that, in general, any given value of d, except for\ni = e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e. This, in fact, is expected\nfrom the symmetry of i and e in Eq. (9.35), i.e., d remains the same if i 239\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nand e are interchanged. Physically, this is related\nto the fact that the path of ray in Fig. 9.21 can be\ntraced back, resulting in the same angle of\ndeviation. At the minimum deviation D , the\nm\nrefracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel\nto its base. We have\nd = D , i = e which implies r = r . m 1 2\nEquation (9.34) gives\nA\n2r = A or r = (9.36)\n2\nIn the same way, Eq.

Periscope, kaleidoscope, binoculars, telescopes, microscopes are some\nexamples of optical devices and instruments that are in common use. Our eye is, of course, one of the most important optical device the nature\nhas endowed us with.", "We have already studied about the human eye in\nClass X. We now go on to describe the principles of working of the\nmicroscope and the telescope. 9.7.1 The microscope\nA simple magnifier or microscope is a converging lens of small focal length\n(Fig. 9.23). In order to use such a lens as a microscope, the lens is held\nnear the object, one focal length away or less, and the eye is positioned\nclose to the lens on the other side. The idea is to get an erect, magnified\nand virtual image of the object at a distance so that it can be viewed\ncomfortably, i.e., at 25 cm or more. If the object is at a distance f, the\n240 image is at infinity. However, if the object is at a distance slightly less\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nFIGURE 9.23 A simple microscope; (a) the magnifying lens is located\nsuch that the image is at the near point, (b) the angle subtanded by the\nobject, is the same as that at the near point, and (c) the object near the\nfocal point of the lens; the image is far off but closer than infinity. than the focal length of the lens, the image is virtual and closer than\ninfinity. Although the closest comfortable distance for viewing the image\nis when it is at the near point (distance D @ 25 cm), it causes some strain\non the eye. Therefore, the image formed at infinity is often considered\nmost suitable for viewing by the relaxed eye. We show both cases, the\nfirst in Fig. 9.23(a), and the second in Fig. 9.23(b) and (c). The linear magnification m, for the image formed at the near point D,\nby a simple microscope can be obtained by using the relation 241\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nv (cid:230) 1 1(cid:246) (cid:230) v (cid:246)\nm= =v(cid:231) – (cid:247) =(cid:231) 1– (cid:247)\nu Ł v f ł Ł f ł\nNow according to our sign convention, v is negative, and is equal in\nmagnitude to D. Thus, the magnification is\n(cid:230) D(cid:246)\nm = Ł(cid:231) 1+ ł(cid:247) (9.39)\nf\nSince D is about 25 cm, to have a magnification of six, one needs a convex\nlens of focal length, f = 5 cm. Note that m = h¢/h where h is the size of the object and h¢ the size of\nthe image. This is also the ratio of the angle subtended by the image\nto that subtended by the object, if placed at D for comfortable viewing. (Note that this is not the angle actually subtended by the object at the\neye, which is h/u.) What a single-lens simple magnifier achieves is that it\nallows the object to be brought closer to the eye than D. We will now find the magnification when the image is at infinity. In\nthis case we will have to obtained the angular magnification. Suppose\nthe object has a height h. The maximum angle it can subtend, and be\nclearly visible (without a lens), is when it is at the near point, i.e., a distance\nD. The angle subtended is then given by\n(cid:230) h(cid:246)\ntan θ = (cid:231) (cid:247) » q (9.40)\no Ł Dł o\nWe now find the angle subtended at the eye by the image when the\nobject is at u.", "From the relations\nh¢ v\n=m =\nh u\nwe have the angle subtended by the image\nh¢ h v h\ntan q = = (cid:215) = »q.

For much larger magnifications, one uses two lenses,\none compounding the effect of the other. This is known as a compound\nmicroscope. A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown largest\nin Fig. 9.24. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a\nreal, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for\noptical\nthe second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple\nmicroscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged\nand virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal telescopes\nplane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation\nat infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly,\nthe final image is inverted with respect to the original object. We now obtain the magnification due to a compound microscope. The ray diagram of Fig. 9.24 shows that the (linear) magnification due to\nthe objective, namely h¢/h, equals\nh¢ L\nm = =\nO h f (9.43)\no\nwhere we have used the result\n(cid:230) h (cid:246) (cid:230) h¢ (cid:246)\ntanβ= Ł(cid:231) ł(cid:247) = Ł(cid:231) ł(cid:247)\nf L\no\nHere h¢ is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f\no\nbeing the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the\nfocal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the\nsecond focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece\n(focal length f ) is called the tube length of the compound microscope. 243\ne\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nAs the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we\nuse the result from the discussion above for the simple microscope to\nobtain the (angular) magnification m due to it [Eq.

In practice, it is difficult to make the focal length much smaller\nthan 1 cm. Also large lenses are required to make L large. For example, with an objective with f = 1.0 cm, and an eyepiece with\no\nfocal length f = 2.0 cm, and a tube length of 20 cm, the magnification is\ne\n(cid:230) (cid:246) (cid:230) (cid:246)\nL D\nm =m m =(cid:231) (cid:247) (cid:231) (cid:247)\no e Ł f ł Ł f ł\no e\n20 25\n(cid:1) (cid:2) (cid:1) 250\n1 2\nVarious other factors such as illumination of the object, contribute to\nthe quality and visibility of the image. In modern microscopes, multi-\ncomponent lenses are used for both the objective and the eyepiece to\nimprove image quality by minimising various optical aberrations (defects)\nin lenses. 9.7.2 Telescope\nThe telescope is used to provide angular magnification of distant objects\n(Fig. 9.25). It also has an objective and an eyepiece. But here, the objective\nhas a large focal length and a much larger aperture than the eyepiece. Light from a distant object enters the objective and a real image is formed\nin the tube at its second focal point. The eyepiece magnifies this image\nproducing a final inverted image. The magnifying power m is the ratio of\nthe angle b subtended at the eye by the final image to the angle a which\nthe object subtends at the lens or the eye.

Refracting telescopes can be used both for\nterrestrial and astronomical observations. For example, consider\na telescope whose objective has a focal length of 100 cm and the eyepiece\na focal length of 1 cm. The magnifying power of this telescope is\nm = 100/1 = 100. Let us consider a pair of stars of actual separation 1¢ (one minute of\narc). The stars appear as though they are separated by an angle of 100 ×\n1¢ = 100¢ =1.67°. FIGURE 9.25 A refracting telescope. The main considerations with an astronomical telescope are its light\ngathering power and its resolution or resolving power. The former clearly\ndepends on the area of the objective. With larger diameters, fainter objects\ncan be observed. The resolving power, or the ability to observe two objects\ndistinctly, which are in very nearly the same direction, also depends on\nthe diameter of the objective. So, the desirable aim in optical telescopes is\nto make them with objective of large diameter. The largest lens objective\nin use has a diameter of 40 inch (~1.02 m). It is at the Yerkes Observatory\nin Wisconsin, USA.", "Such big lenses tend to be very heavy and therefore,\ndifficult to make and support by their edges. Further, it is rather difficult\nand expensive to make such large sized lenses which form images that\nare free from any kind of chromatic aberration and distortions. For these reasons, modern telescopes use a concave mirror rather\nthan a lens for the objective. Telescopes with mirror objectives are called\nreflecting telescopes. There is no chromatic aberration in a mirror. Mechanical support is much less of a problem since a mirror weighs\nmuch less than a lens of equivalent optical quality, and can be supported\nover its entire back surface, not just over its rim. One obvious problem\nwith a reflecting telescope is that the objective mirror focusses light inside 245\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nFIGURE 9.26 Schematic diagram of a reflecting telescope (Cassegrain). the telescope tube. One must have an eyepiece and the observer right\nthere, obstructing some light (depending on the size of the observer cage). This is what is done in the very large 200 inch (~5.08 m) diameters, Mt. Palomar telescope, California. The viewer sits near the focal point of the\nmirror, in a small cage. Another solution to the problem is to deflect the\nlight being focussed by another mirror. One such arrangement using a\nconvex secondary mirror to focus the incident light, which now passes\nthrough a hole in the objective primary mirror, is shown in Fig. 9.26. This is known as a Cassegrain telescope, after its inventor. It has the\nadvantages of a large focal length in a short telescope. The largest telescope\nin India is in Kavalur, Tamil Nadu. It is a 2.34 m diameter reflecting\ntelescope (Cassegrain). It was ground, polished, set up, and is being used\nby the Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore. The largest reflecting\ntelescopes in the world are the pair of Keck telescopes in Hawaii, USA,\nwith a reflector of 10 metre in diameter. SUMMARY\n1. Reflection is governed by the equation —i = —r¢ and refraction by the\nSnell’s law, sini/sinr = n, where the incident ray, reflected ray, refracted\nray and normal lie in the same plane. Angles of incidence, reflection\nand refraction are i, r ¢ and r, respectively. 2. The critical angle of incidence i for a ray incident from a denser to rarer\nc\nmedium, is that angle for which the angle of refraction is 90°. For\ni > i, total internal reflection occurs. Multiple internal reflections in\nc\ndiamond (i @ 24.4°), totally reflecting prisms and mirage, are some\nc\nexamples of total internal reflection. Optical fibres consist of glass\nfibres coated with a thin layer of material of lower refractive index. Light incident at an angle at one end comes out at the other, after\nmultiple internal reflections, even if the fibre is bent. 246\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\n3.

Magnifying power m of a simple microscope is given by m = 1 + (D/f),\nwhere D = 25 cm is the least distance of distinct vision and f is the\nfocal length of the convex lens. If the image is at infinity, m = D/f. For\na compound microscope, the magnifying power is given by m = m × m\ne 0\nwhere m = 1 + (D/f ), is the magnification due to the eyepiece and m\ne e o\nis the magnification produced by the objective. Approximately,\nL D\nm = ·\nf f\no e\nwhere f and f are the focal lengths of the objective and eyepiece,\no e\nrespectively, and L is the distance between their focal points. 9.

POINTS TO PONDER\n1. The laws of reflection and refraction are true for all surfaces and\npairs of media at the point of the incidence. 2. The real image of an object placed between f and 2f from a convex lens\ncan be seen on a screen placed at the image location. If the screen is\nremoved, is the image still there? This question puzzles many, because\nit is difficult to reconcile ourselves with an image suspended in air\nwithout a screen. But the image does exist. Rays from a given point\non the object are converging to an image point in space and diverging\naway.", "The screen simply diffuses these rays, some of which reach our\neye and we see the image. This can be seen by the images formed in\nair during a laser show. 3. Image formation needs regular reflection/refraction. In principle, all\nrays from a given point should reach the same image point. This is\nwhy you do not see your image by an irregular reflecting object, say\nthe page of a book. 4. Thick lenses give coloured images due to dispersion. The variety in\ncolour of objects we see around us is due to the constituent colours\nof the light incident on them. A monochromatic light may produce an\nentirely different perception about the colours on an object as seen in\nwhite light. 5. For a simple microscope, the angular size of the object equals the\nangular size of the image. Yet it offers magnification because we can\nkeep the small object much closer to the eye than 25 cm and hence\nhave it subtend a large angle. The image is at 25 cm which we can see. Without the microscope, you would need to keep the small object at\n25 cm which would subtend a very small angle. 248\nReprint 2025-26\nRay Optics and\nOptical Instruments\nEXERCISES\n9.1 A small candle, 2.5 cm in size is placed at 27 cm in front of a concave\nmirror of radius of curvature 36 cm.
