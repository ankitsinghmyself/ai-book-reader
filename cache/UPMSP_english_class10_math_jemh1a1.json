["218 MATHEMATICS\nA1\nP M\nROOFS IN ATHEMATICS\nA1.1 Introduction\nThe ability to reason and think clearly is extremely useful in our daily life. For example,\nsuppose a politician tells you, ‘If you are interested in a clean government, then you\nshould vote for me.’ What he actually wants you to believe is that if you do not vote for\nhim, then you may not get a clean government. Similarly, if an advertisement tells you,\n‘The intelligent wear XYZ shoes’, what the company wants you to conclude is that if\nyou do not wear XYZ shoes, then you are not intelligent enough. You can yourself\nobserve that both the above statements may mislead the general public. So, if we\nunderstand the process of reasoning correctly, we do not fall into such traps\nunknowingly. The correct use of reasoning is at the core of mathematics, especially in constructing\nproofs. In Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of proofs, and you actually proved\nmany statements, especially in geometry. Recall that a proof is made up of several\nmathematical statements, each of which is logically deduced from a previous statement\nin the proof, or from a theorem proved earlier, or an axiom, or the hypotheses. The\nmain tool, we use in constructing a proof, is the process of deductive reasoning. We start the study of this chapter with a review of what a mathematical statement\nis. Then, we proceed to sharpen our skills in deductive reasoning using several examples. We shall also deal with the concept of negation and finding the negation of a given\nstatement. Then, we discuss what it means to find the converse of a given statement. Finally, we review the ingredients of a proof learnt in Class IX by analysing the proofs\nof several theorems. Here, we also discuss the idea of proof by contradiction, which\nyou have come across in Class IX and many other chapters of this book. A1.2 Mathematical Statements Revisited\nRecall, that a ‘statement’ is a meaningful sentence which is not an order, or an\nexclamation or a question. For example, ‘Which two teams are playing in the\nReprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 219\nCricket World Cup Final?’ is a question, not a statement. ‘Go and finish your homework’\nis an order, not a statement. ‘What a fantastic goal!’ is an exclamation, not a statement. Remember, in general, statements can be one of the following:\n always true\n always false\n ambiguous\nIn Class IX, you have also studied that in mathematics, a statement is\nacceptable only if it is either always true or always false. So, ambiguous sentences\nare not considered as mathematical statements. Let us review our understanding with a few examples. Example 1 : State whether the following statements are always true, always false or\nambiguous. Justify your answers. (i) The Sun orbits the Earth. (ii) Vehicles have four wheels. (iii) The speed of light is approximately 3 × 105 km/s. (iv) A road to Kolkata will be closed from November to March. (v) All humans are mortal.", "Solution :\n(i) This statement is always false, since astronomers have established that the Earth\norbits the Sun. (ii) This statement is ambiguous, because we cannot decide if it is always true or\nalways false. This depends on what the vehicle is — vehicles can have 2, 3, 4, 6,\n10, etc., wheels. (iii) This statement is always true, as verified by physicists. (iv) This statement is ambiguous, because it is not clear which road is being referred\nto. (v) This statement is always true, since every human being has to die some time. Example 2 : State whether the following statements are true or false, and justify your\nanswers. (i) All equilateral triangles are isosceles. (ii) Some isosceles triangles are equilateral. (iii) All isosceles triangles are equilateral. (iv) Some rational numbers are integers. Reprint 2025-26\n220 MATHEMATICS\n(v) Some rational numbers are not integers. (vi) Not all integers are rational. (vii) Between any two rational numbers there is no rational number. Solution :\n(i) This statement is true, because equilateral triangles have equal sides, and therefore\nare isosceles. (ii) This statement is true, because those isosceles triangles whose base angles are\n60° are equilateral. (iii) This statement is false. Give a counter-example for it. p\n(iv) This statement is true, since rational numbers of the form , where p is an\nq\n3\ninteger and q = 1, are integers (for example, 3 ). 1\np\n(v) This statement is true, because rational numbers of the form , p, q are integers\nq\n3\nand q does not divide p, are not integers (for example, ). 2\n(vi) This statement is the same as saying ‘there is an integer which is not a rational\nnumber’. This is false, because all integers are rational numbers. (vii) This statement is false. As you know, between any two rational numbers r and s\nr s\nlies , which is a rational number. 2\nExample 3 : If x < 4, which of the following statements are true? Justify your answers. (i) 2x > 8 (ii) 2x < 6 (iii) 2x < 8\nSolution :\n(i) This statement is false, because, for example, x = 3 < 4 does not satisfy 2x > 8. (ii) This statement is false, because, for example, x = 3.5 < 4 does not satisfy 2x < 6. (iii) This statement is true, because it is the same as x < 4. Example 4 : Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that\nthey become true statements:\n(i) If the diagonals of a quadrilateral are equal, then it is a rectangle. (ii) A line joining two points on two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side. (iii) p is irrational for all positive integers p. (iv) All quadratic equations have two real roots. Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 221\nSolution :\n(i) If the diagonals of a parallelogram are equal, then it is a rectangle. (ii) A line joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side. (iii) p is irrational for all primes p. (iv) All quadratic equations have at most two real roots. Remark : There can be other ways of restating the statements above.", "For instance,\n(iii) can also be restated as ‘ p is irrational for all positive integers p which are not a\nperfect square’. EXERCISE A1.1\n1. State whether the following statements are always true, always false or ambiguous. Justify your answers. (i) All mathematics textbooks are interesting. (ii) The distance from the Earth to the Sun is approximately 1.5 × 108 km. (iii) All human beings grow old. (iv) The journey from Uttarkashi to Harsil is tiring. (v) The woman saw an elephant through a pair of binoculars. 2. State whether the following statements are true or false. Justify your answers. (i) All hexagons are polygons. (ii) Some polygons are pentagons. (iii) Not all even numbers are divisible by 2. (iv) Some real numbers are irrational. (v) Not all real numbers are rational. 3. Let a and b be real numbers such that ab  0. Then which of the following statements are\ntrue? Justify your answers. (i) Both a and b must be zero. (ii) Both a and b must be non-zero. (iii) Either a or b must be non-zero. 4. Restate the following statements with appropriate conditions, so that they become true. (i) If a2 > b2, then a > b. (ii) If x2 = y2 , then x = y. (iii) If (x + y)2 = x2 + y2, then x = 0. (iv) The diagonals of a quadrilateral\nbisect each other. A1.3 Deductive Reasoning\nIn Class IX, you were introduced to the idea of deductive reasoning. Here, we will\nwork with many more examples which will illustrate how deductive reasoning is\nReprint 2025-26\n222 MATHEMATICS\nused to deduce conclusions from given statements that we assume to be true. The\ngiven statements are called ‘premises’ or ‘hypotheses’. We begin with some examples. Example 5 : Given that Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka, and suppose Shabana\nlives in Bijapur. In which state does Shabana live? Solution : Here we have two premises:\n(i) Bijapur is in the state of Karnataka (ii) Shabana lives in Bijapur\nFrom these premises, we deduce that Shabana lives in the state of Karnataka. Example 6 : Given that all mathematics textbooks are interesting, and suppose you\nare reading a mathematics textbook. What can we conclude about the textbook you\nare reading? Solution : Using the two premises (or hypotheses), we can deduce that you are\nreading an interesting textbook. Example 7 : Given that y = – 6x + 5, and suppose x = 3. What is y? Solution : Given the two hypotheses, we get y = – 6 (3) + 5 = – 13. Example 8 : Given that ABCD is a parallelogram,\nand suppose AD = 5 cm, AB = 7 cm (see Fig. A1.1). What can you conclude about the lengths of DC and\nBC? Solution : We are given that ABCD is a parallelogram. So, we deduce that all the properties that hold for a Fig. A1.1\nparallelogram hold for ABCD. Therefore, in particular,\nthe property that ‘the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal to each other’, holds. Since we know AD = 5 cm, we can deduce that BC = 5 cm. Similarly, we deduce that\nDC = 7 cm.", "Remark : In this example, we have seen how we will often need to find out and use\nproperties hidden in a given premise. Example 9 : Given that p is irrational for all primes p, and suppose that 19423 is a\nprime. What can you conclude about 19423? Solution : We can conclude that 19423 is irrational. In the examples above, you might have noticed that we do not know whether the\nhypotheses are true or not. We are assuming that they are true, and then applying\ndeductive reasoning. For instance, in Example 9, we haven’t checked whether 19423\nReprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 223\nis a prime or not; we assume it to be a prime for the sake of our argument.What we\nare trying to emphasise in this section is that given a particular statement, how we use\ndeductive reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. What really matters here is that we use\nthe correct process of reasoning, and this process of reasoning does not depend on the\ntrueness or falsity of the hypotheses. However, it must also be noted that if we start\nwith an incorrect premise (or hypothesis), we may arrive at a wrong conclusion. EXERCISE A1.2\n1. Given that all women are mortal, and suppose that A is a woman, what can we conclude\nabout A? 2. Given that the product of two rational numbers is rational, and suppose a and b are\nrationals, what can you conclude about ab? 3. Given that the decimal expansion of irrational numbers is non-terminating, non-recurring,\nand 17 is irrational, what can we conclude about the decimal expansion\nof 17? 4. Given that y = x2 + 6 and x = – 1, what can we conclude about the value of y? 5. Given that ABCD is a parallelogram and  B = 80°. What can you conclude about the\nother angles of the parallelogram? 6. Given that PQRS is a cyclic quadrilateral and also its diagonals bisect each other. What\ncan you conclude about the quadrilateral? 7. Given that p is irrational for all primes p and also suppose that 3721 is a prime. Can\nyou conclude that 3721 is an irrational number? Is your conclusion correct? Why or\nwhy not? A1.4 Conjectures, Theorems, Proofs and Mathematical Reasoning\nConsider the Fig. A1.2. The first circle\nhas one point on it, the second two points,\nthe third three, and so on. All possible\nlines connecting the points are drawn in\neach case. The lines divide the circle into\nmutually exclusive regions (having no\ncommon portion). We can count these\nand tabulate our results as shown :\nFig. A1.2\nReprint 2025-26\n224 MATHEMATICS\nNumber of points Number of regions\n1 1\n2 2\n3 4\n4 8\n5\n6\n7\nSome of you might have come up with a formula predicting the number of regions\ngiven the number of points. From Class IX, you may remember that this intelligent\nguess is called a ‘conjecture’. Suppose your conjecture is that given ‘n’ points on a circle, there are 2n – 1\nmutually exclusive regions, created by joining the points with all possible lines. This\nseems an extremely sensible guess, and one can check that if n = 5, we do get 16\nregions.", "So, having verified this formula for 5 points, are you satisfied that for any n\npoints there are 2n – 1 regions? If so, how would you respond, if someone asked you,\nhow you can be sure about this for n = 25, say? To deal with such questions, you\nwould need a proof which shows beyond doubt that this result is true, or a counter-\nexample to show that this result fails for some ‘n’. Actually, if you are patient and try\nit out for n = 6, you will find that there are 31 regions, and for n = 7 there are 57\nregions. So, n = 6, is a counter-example to the conjecture above. This demonstrates\nthe power of a counter-example. You may recall that in the Class IX we discussed\nthat to disprove a statement, it is enough to come up with a single counter-\nexample. You may have noticed that we insisted on a proof regarding the number\nof regions in spite of verifying the result for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Let us consider\na few more examples. You are familiar with the following result (given in Chapter 5):\nn(n1)\n1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = . To establish its validity, it is not enough to verify the\n2\nresult for n = 1, 2, 3, and so on, because there may be some ‘n’ for which this result is\nnot true (just as in the example above, the result failed for n = 6). What we need is a\nproof which establishes its truth beyond doubt. You shall learn a proof for the same in\nhigher classes. Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 225\nNow, consider Fig. A1.3, where PQ and PR\nare tangents to the circle drawn from P. You have proved that PQ = PR (Theorem 10.2). You were not satisfied by only drawing several such\nfigures, measuring the lengths of the respective\ntangents, and verifying for yourselves that the result\nFig. A1.3\nwas true in each case. Do you remember what did the proof consist of ? It consisted of a sequence of\nstatements (called valid arguments), each following from the earlier statements in\nthe proof, or from previously proved (and known) results independent from the result\nto be proved, or from axioms, or from definitions, or from the assumptions you had\nmade. And you concluded your proof with the statement PQ = PR, i.e., the statement\nyou wanted to prove. This is the way any proof is constructed. We shall now look at some examples and theorems and analyse their proofs to\nhelp us in getting a better understanding of how they are constructed. We begin by using the so-called ‘direct’ or ‘deductive’ method of proof. In this\nmethod, we make several statements. Each is based on previous statements. If\neach statement is logically correct (i.e., a valid argument), it leads to a logically correct\nconclusion. Example 10 : The sum of two rational numbers is a rational number.

Remark : Note that, each statement in the proof above is based on a previously\nestablished fact, or definition.

Before we start, we\nwould like to introduce some notation, which will make it easy for us to understand\nthese concepts. To start with, let us look at a statement as a single unit, and give it a\nname. For example, we can denote the statement ‘It rained in Delhi on 1 September\n2005’ by p. We can also write this by\np: It rained in Delhi on 1 September 2005. Similarly, let us write\nq: All teachers are female. r: Mike’s dog has a black tail. s: 2 + 2 = 4. t: Triangle ABC is equilateral. This notation now helps us to discuss properties of statements, and also to see\nhow we can combine them. In the beginning we will be working with what we call\n‘simple’ statements, and will then move onto ‘compound’ statements. Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 229\nNow consider the following table in which we make a new statement from each\nof the given statements. Original statement New statement\np: It rained in Delhi on ~p: It is false that it rained in Delhi\n1 September 2005 on 1 September 2005. q: All teachers are female. ~ q: It is false that all teachers are\nfemale. r: Mike’s dog has a black tail. ~r: It is false that Mike’s dog has a\nblack tail. s: 2 + 2 = 4. ~s: It is false that 2 + 2 = 4. t: Triangle ABC is equilateral. ~t: It is false that triangle ABC is\nequilateral. Each new statement in the table is a negation of the corresponding old statement. That is, ~p, ~q, ~r, ~s and ~t are negations of the statements p, q, r, s and t, respectively. Here, ~p is read as ‘not p’. The statement ~p negates the assertion that the statement\np makes. Notice that in our usual talk we would simply mean ~p as ‘It did not rain in\nDelhi on 1 September 2005.’ However, we need to be careful while doing so. You\nmight think that one can obtain the negation of a statement by simply inserting the\nword ‘not’ in the given statement at a suitable place. While this works in the case of\np, the difficulty comes when we have a statement that begins with ‘all’.", "Consider, for\nexample, the statement q: All teachers are female. We said the negation of this statement\nis ~q: It is false that all teachers are female. This is the same as the statement ‘There\nare some teachers who are males.’ Now let us see what happens if we simply insert\n‘not’ in q. We obtain the statement: ‘All teachers are not female’, or we can obtain the\nstatement: ‘Not all teachers are female.’ The first statement can confuse people. It\ncould imply (if we lay emphasis on the word ‘All’) that all teachers are male! This is\ncertainly not the negation of q. However, the second statement gives the meaning of\n~q, i.e., that there is at least one teacher who is not a female. So, be careful when\nwriting the negation of a statement! So, how do we decide that we have the correct negation? We use the following\ncriterion. Let p be a statement and ~p its negation. Then ~p is false whenever p is\ntrue, and ~p is true whenever p is false. Reprint 2025-26\n230 MATHEMATICS\nFor example, if it is true that Mike’s dog has a black tail, then it is false that\nMike’s dog does not have a black tail. If it is false that ‘Mike’s dog has a black tail’,\nthen it is true that ‘Mike’s dog does not have a black tail’. Similarly, the negations for the statements s and t are:\ns: 2 + 2 = 4; negation, ~s: 2 + 2  4. t: Triangle ABC is equilateral; negation, ~t: Triangle ABC is not equilateral. Now, what is ~(~s)? It would be 2 + 2 = 4, which is s. And what is ~(~t)? This\nwould be ‘the triangle ABC is equilateral’, i.e., t. In fact, for any statement p, ~(~p)\nis p. Example 12 : State the negations for the following statements:\n(i) Mike’s dog does not have a black tail. (ii) All irrational numbers are real numbers. (iii) 2 is irrational. (iv) Some rational numbers are integers. (v) Not all teachers are males. (vi) Some horses are not brown. (vii) There is no real number x, such that x2 = – 1. Solution :\n(i) It is false that Mike’s dog does not have a black tail, i.e., Mike’s dog has a black\ntail. (ii) It is false that all irrational numbers are real numbers, i.e., some (at least one)\nirrational numbers are not real numbers. One can also write this as, ‘Not all\nirrational numbers are real numbers.’\n(iii) It is false that 2 is irrational, i.e., 2 is not irrational. (iv) It is false that some rational numbers are integers, i.e., no rational number is an\ninteger. (v) It is false that not all teachers are males, i.e., all teachers are males. (vi) It is false that some horses are not brown, i.e., all horses are brown. (vii) It is false that there is no real number x, such that x2 = – 1, i.e., there is at least\none real number x, such that x2 = – 1. Remark : From the above discussion, you may arrive at the following Working Rule\nfor obtaining the negation of a statement :\n(i) First write the statement with a ‘not’. (ii) If there is any confusion, make suitable modification , specially in the statements\ninvolving ‘All’ or ‘Some’.", "Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 231\nEXERCISE A1.4\n1. State the negations for the following statements :\n(i) Man is mortal. (ii) Line l is parallel to line m. (iii) This chapter has many exercises. (iv) All integers are rational numbers. (v) Some prime numbers are odd. (vi) No student is lazy. (vii) Some cats are not black. (viii) There is no real number x, such that x  1. (ix) 2 divides the positive integer a. (x) Integers a and b are coprime. 2. In each of the following questions, there are two statements. State if the second is the\nnegation of the first or not. (i) Mumtaz is hungry. (ii) Some cats are black. Mumtaz is not hungry. Some cats are brown. (iii) All elephants are huge. (iv) All fire engines are red. One elephant is not huge. All fire engines are not red. (v) No man is a cow. Some men are cows. A1.6 Converse of a Statement\nWe now investigate the notion of the converse of a statement. For this, we need the\nnotion of a ‘compound’ statement, that is, a statement which is a combination of one or\nmore ‘simple’ statements. There are many ways of creating compound statements,\nbut we will focus on those that are created by connecting two simple statements with\nthe use of the words ‘if’ and ‘then’. For example, the statement ‘If it is raining, then it\nis difficult to go on a bicycle’, is made up of two statements:\np: It is raining\nq: It is difficult to go on a bicycle. Using our previous notation we can say: If p, then q. We can also say ‘p implies\nq’, and denote it by p  q. Now, supose you have the statement ‘If the water tank is black, then it contains\npotable water.’ This is of the form p  q, where the hypothesis is p (the water tank\nis black) and the conclusion is q (the tank contains potable water). Suppose we\ninterchange the hypothesis and the conclusion, what do we get? We get q  p, i.e., if\nthe water in the tank is potable, then the tank must be black. This statement is called\nthe converse of the statement p  q. Reprint 2025-26\n232 MATHEMATICS\nIn general, the converse of the statement p  q is q  p, where p and q are\nstatements. Note that p  q and q  p are the converses of each other. Example 13 : Write the converses of the following statements :\n(i) If Jamila is riding a bicycle, then 17 August falls on a Sunday. (ii) If 17 August is a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle. (iii) If Pauline is angry, then her face turns red. (iv) If a person has a degree in education, then she is allowed to teach. (v) If a person has a viral infection, then he runs a high temperature. (vi) If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India. (vii) If triangle ABC is equilateral, then all its interior angles are equal. (viii) If x is an irrational number, then the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating\nnon-recurring. (ix) If x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x), then p(a) = 0. Solution : Each statement above is of the form p  q. So, to find the converse, we\nfirst identify p and q, and then write q  p.", "(i) p: Jamila is riding a bicycle, and q: 17 August falls on a Sunday. Therefore, the\nconverse is: If 17 August falls on a Sunday, then Jamila is riding a bicycle. (ii) This is the converse of (i). Therefore, its converse is the statement given in\n(i) above. (iii) If Pauline’s face turns red, then she is angry. (iv) If a person is allowed to teach, then she has a degree in education. (v) If a person runs a high temperature, then he has a viral infection. (vi) If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai. (vii) If all the interior angles of triangle ABC are equal, then it is equilateral. (viii) If the decimal expansion of x is non-terminating non-recurring, then x is an\nirrational number. (ix) If p(a) = 0, then x – a is a factor of the polynomial p(x). Notice that we have simply written the converse of each of the statements\nabove without worrying if they are true or false. For example, consider the following\nstatement: If Ahmad is in Mumbai, then he is in India. This statement is true. Now\nconsider the converse: If Ahmad is in India, then he is in Mumbai. This need not be\ntrue always – he could be in any other part of India.

Example 14 : State the converses of the following statements. In each case, also\ndecide whether the converse is true or false. (i) If n is an even integer, then 2n + 1 is an odd integer. (ii) If the decimal expansion of a real number is terminating, then the number is\nrational. (iii) If a transversal intersects two parallel lines, then each pair of corresponding\nangles is equal. (iv) If each pair of opposite sides of a quadrilateral is equal, then the quadrilateral is\na parallelogram. (v) If two triangles are congruent, then their corresponding angles are equal. Solution :\n(i) The converse is ‘If 2n + 1 is an odd integer, then n is an even integer.’ This is a\nfalse statement (for example, 15 = 2(7) + 1, and 7 is odd). (ii) ‘If a real number is rational, then its decimal expansion is terminating’, is the\nconverse. This is a false statement, because a rational number can also have a\nnon-terminating recurring decimal expansion. (iii) The converse is ‘If a transversal intersects two lines in such a way that each\npair of corresponding angles are equal, then the two lines are parallel.’ We have\nassumed, by Axiom 6.4 of your Class IX textbook, that this statement is true. (iv) ‘If a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, then each pair of its opposite sides is equal’,\nis the converse. This is true (Theorem 8.1, Class IX). (v) ‘If the corresponding angles in two triangles are equal, then they are congruent’,\nis the converse. This statement is false. We leave it to you to find suitable counter-\nexamples. EXERCISE A1.5\n1. Write the converses of the following statements. (i) If it is hot in Tokyo, then Sharan sweats a lot.", "(ii) If Shalini is hungry, then her stomach grumbles. (iii) If Jaswant has a scholarship, then she can get a degree. (iv) If a plant has flowers, then it is alive. (v) If an animal is a cat, then it has a tail. Reprint 2025-26\n234 MATHEMATICS\n2. Write the converses of the following statements. Also, decide in each case whether the\nconverse is true or false. (i) If triangle ABC is isosceles, then its base angles are equal. (ii) If an integer is odd, then its square is an odd integer. (iii) If x2 = 1, then x = 1. (iv) If ABCD is a parallelogram, then AC and BD bisect each other. (v) If a, b and c, are whole numbers, then a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c. (vi) If x and y are two odd numbers, then x + y is an even number. (vii) If vertices of a parallelogram lie on a circle, then it is a rectangle. A1.7 Proof by Contradiction\nSo far, in all our examples, we used direct arguments to establish the truth of the\nresults. We now explore ‘indirect’ arguments, in particular, a very powerful tool in\nmathematics known as ‘proof by contradiction’. We have already used this method in\nChapter 1 to establish the irrationality of several numbers and also in other chapters to\nprove some theorems. Here, we do several more examples to illustrate the idea. Before we proceed, let us explain what a contradiction is. In mathematics, a\ncontradiction occurs when we get a statement p such that p is true and ~p, its negation,\nis also true. For example,\na\np: x , where a and b are coprime. b\nq: 2 divides both ‘a’ and ‘b’. If we assume that p is true and also manage to show that q is true, then we have\narrived at a contradiction, because q implies that the negation of p is true. If you\nremember, this is exactly what happened when we tried to prove that 2 is irrational\n(see Chapter 1). How does proof by contradiction work? Let us see this through a specific example. Suppose we are given the following :\nAll women are mortal. A is a woman. Prove that A is mortal. Even though this is a rather easy example, let us see how we can prove this by\ncontradiction.  Let us assume that we want to establish the truth of a statement p (here we\nwant to show that p : ‘A is mortal’ is true). Reprint 2025-26\nPROOFS IN MATHEMATICS 235\n So, we begin by assuming that the statement is not true, that is, we assume that\nthe negation of p is true (i.e., A is not mortal).  We then proceed to carry out a series of logical deductions based on the truth of\nthe negation of p. (Since A is not mortal, we have a counter-example to the\nstatement ‘All women are mortal.’ Hence, it is false that all women are mortal.)\n If this leads to a contradiction, then the contradiction arises because of our faulty\nassumption that p is not true. (We have a contradiction, since we have shown\nthat the statement ‘All women are mortal’ and its negation, ‘Not all women are\nmortal’ is true at the same time. This contradiction arose, because we assumed\nthat A is not mortal.)\n Therefore, our assumption is wrong, i.e., p has to be true.", "(So, A is mortal.)\nLet us now look at examples from mathematics. Example 15 : The product of a non-zero rational number and an irrational number is\nirrational. Solution :\nStatements Analysis/Comment\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Let r be a non-\nzero rational number and x be an irrational number. m\nLet r  , where m, n are integers and m  0,\nn\nn  0. We need to prove that rx is irrational. Assume rx is rational. Here, we are assuming the\nnegation of the statement that\nwe need to prove. p\nThen rx , q  0, where p and q are integers. This follow from the\nq\nprevious statement and the\ndefinition of a rational\nnumber. p\nRearranging the equation rx , q  0, and\nq\nm p np\nusing the fact that r , we get x  . n rq mq\nReprint 2025-26\n236 MATHEMATICS\nSince np and mq are integers and mq  0, Using properties of integers,\nx is a rational number. and definition of a rational\nnumber. This is a contradiction, because we have shown x This is what we were looking\nto be rational, but by our hypothesis, we have x for — a contradiction. is irrational. The contradiction has arisen because of the faulty Logical deduction. assumption that rx is rational. Therefore, rx\nis irrational. We now prove Example 11, but this time using proof by contradiction. The proof\nis given below:\nStatements Analysis/Comment\nLet us assume that the statement is note true. As we saw earlier, this is the\nstarting point for an argument\nusing ‘proof by contradiction’. So we suppose that there exists a prime number This is the negation of the\np > 3, which is not of the form 6n + 1 or 6n + 5, statement in the result. where n is a whole number. Using Euclid’s division lemma on division by 6, Using earlier proved results. and using the fact that p is not of the form 6n + 1\nor 6n + 5, we get p = 6n or 6n + 2 or 6n + 3\nor 6n + 4. Therefore, p is divisible by either 2 or 3. Logical deduction. So, p is not a prime. Logical deduction. This is a contradiction, because by our hypothesis Precisely what we want! p is prime. The contradiction has arisen, because we assumed\nthat there exists a prime number p > 3 which is\nnot of the form 6n + 1 or 6n + 5. Hence, every prime number greater than 3 is of the We reach the conclusion. form 6n + 1 or 6n + 5.
