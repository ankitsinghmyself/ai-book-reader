["STATISTICS 171\n13\nS\nTATISTICS\n13.1 Introduction\nIn Class IX, you have studied the classification of given data into ungrouped as well as\ngrouped frequency distributions. You have also learnt to represent the data pictorially\nin the form of various graphs such as bar graphs, histograms (including those of varying\nwidths) and frequency polygons. In fact, you went a step further by studying certain\nnumerical representatives of the ungrouped data, also called measures of central\ntendency, namely, mean, median and mode. In this chapter, we shall extend the study\nof these three measures, i.e., mean, median and mode from ungrouped data to that of\ngrouped data. We shall also discuss the concept of cumulative frequency, the\ncumulative frequency distribution and how to draw cumulative frequency curves, called\nogives. 13.2 Mean of Grouped Data\nThe mean (or average) of observations, as we know, is the sum of the values of all the\nobservations divided by the total number of observations. From Class IX, recall that if\nx , x ,. . ., x are observations with respective frequencies f , f , . . ., f , then this\n1 2 n 1 2 n\nmeans observation x occurs f times, x occurs f times, and so on. 1 1 2 2\nNow, the sum of the values of all the observations = f x + f x + . . . + f x , and\n1 1 2 2 n n\nthe number of observations = f + f + . . . + f . 1 2 n\nSo, the mean x of the data is given by\nf x  f x  f x\nx = 1 1 2 2 n n\nf  f  f\n1 2 n\nRecall that we can write this in short form by using the Greek letter  (capital\nsigma) which means summation. That is,\nReprint 2025-26\n172 MATHEMATICS\nn\n f x\ni i\nx = i1\nn\n f\ni\ni1\n f x\nwhich, more briefly, is written as x = i i , if it is understood that i varies from\n f\n1 to n. i\nLet us apply this formula to find the mean in the following example. Example 1 : The marks obtained by 30 students of Class X of a certain school in a\nMathematics paper consisting of 100 marks are presented in table below. Find the\nmean of the marks obtained by the students. Marks obtained 10 20 36 40 50 56 60 70 72 80 88 92 95\n(x)\ni\nNumber of 1 1 3 4 3 2 4 4 1 1 2 3 1\nstudents (f)\ni\nSolution: Recall that to find the mean marks, we require the product of each x with\ni\nthe corresponding frequency f. So, let us put them in a column as shown in Table 13.1. i\nTable 13.1\nMarks obtained (x ) Number of students (f ) fx\ni i i i\n10 1 10\n20 1 20\n. 36 3 108\n40 4 160\n50 3 150\n56 2 112\n60 4 240\n70 4 280\n72 1 72\n80 1 80\n88 2 176\n92 3 276\n95 1 95\nTotal f = 30 fx = 1779\ni i i\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 173\n f x 1779\nNow, x  i i = = 59.3\n f 30\ni\nTherefore, the mean marks obtained is 59.3. In most of our real life situations, data is usually so large that to make a meaningful\nstudy it needs to be condensed as grouped data. So, we need to convert given ungrouped\ndata into grouped data and devise some method to find its mean. Let us convert the ungrouped data of Example 1 into grouped data by forming\nclass-intervals of width, say 15.", "Remember that, while allocating frequencies to each\nclass-interval, students falling in any upper class-limit would be considered in the next\nclass, e.g., 4 students who have obtained 40 marks would be considered in the class-\ninterval 40-55 and not in 25-40. With this convention in our mind, let us form a grouped\nfrequency distribution table (see Table 13.2). Table 13.2\nClass interval 10 - 25 25 - 40 40 - 55 55 - 70 70 - 85 85 - 100\nNumber of students 2 3 7 6 6 6\nNow, for each class-interval, we require a point which would serve as the\nrepresentative of the whole class. It is assumed that the frequency of each class-\ninterval is centred around its mid-point. So the mid-point (or class mark) of each\nclass can be chosen to represent the observations falling in the class. Recall that we\nfind the mid-point of a class (or its class mark) by finding the average of its upper and\nlower limits. That is,\nUpperclasslimit +Lowerclasslimit\nClass mark =\n2\n10+25\nWith reference to Table 13.2, for the class 10-25, the class mark is , i.e.,\n2\n17.5. Similarly, we can find the class marks of the remaining class intervals. We put\nthem in Table 13.3. These class marks serve as our x’s. Now, in general, for the ith\ni\nclass interval, we have the frequency f corresponding to the class mark x. We can\ni i\nnow proceed to compute the mean in the same manner as in Example 1.

So, the mean x of the\ni i\ngiven data is given by\nΣf x 1860.0\nx = i i = = 62\nΣf 30\ni\nThis new method of finding the mean is known as the Direct Method. We observe that Tables 13.1 and 13.3 are using the same data and employing the\nsame formula for the calculation of the mean but the results obtained are different. Can you think why this is so, and which one is more accurate? The difference in the\ntwo values is because of the mid-point assumption in Table 13.3, 59.3 being the exact\nmean, while 62 an approximate mean. Sometimes when the numerical values of x and f are large, finding the product\ni i\nof x and f becomes tedious and time consuming. So, for such situations, let us think of\ni i\na method of reducing these calculations. We can do nothing with the f’s, but we can change each x to a smaller number\ni i\nso that our calculations become easy. How do we do this? What about subtracting a\nfixed number from each of these x’s? Let us try this method. i\nThe first step is to choose one among the x’s as the assumed mean, and denote\ni\nit by ‘a’. Also, to further reduce our calculation work, we may take ‘a’ to be that x\ni\nwhich lies in the centre of x , x , . . ., x . So, we can choose a = 47.5 or a = 62.5. Let\n1 2 n\nus choose a = 47.5.", "The next step is to find the difference d between a and each of the x’s, that is,\ni i\nthe deviation of ‘a’ from each of the x’s. i\ni.e., d = x – a = x – 47.5\ni i i\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 175\nThe third step is to find the product of d with the corresponding f, and take the sum\ni i\nof all the f d’s. The calculations are shown in Table 13.4. i i\nTable 13.4\nClass interval Number of Class mark d = x – 47.5 fd\ni i i i\nstudents (f ) (x)\ni i\n10 - 25 2 17.5 –30 –60\n25 - 40 3 32.5 –15 –45\n40 - 55 7 47.5 0 0\n55 - 70 6 62.5 15 90\n70 - 85 6 77.5 30 180\n85 - 100 6 92.5 45 270\nTotal Σf = 30 Σfd = 435\ni i i\nΣf d\nSo, from Table 13.4, the mean of the deviations, d = i i . Σf\ni\nNow, let us find the relation between d and x. Since in obtaining d, we subtracted ‘a’ from each x, so, in order to get the mean\ni i\nx, we need to add ‘a’ to d . This can be explained mathematically as:\nΣf d\nMean of deviations, d = i i\nΣf\ni\nΣf (x − a)\nSo, d = i i\nΣf\ni\nΣf x Σf a\n= i i − i\nΣf Σf\ni i\nΣf\n= x − a i\nΣf\ni\n= x − a\nSo, x = a + d\nΣf d\ni.e., x = a + i i\nΣf\ni\nReprint 2025-26\n176 MATHEMATICS\nSubstituting the values of a, Σfd and Σf from Table 13.4, we get\ni i i\n435\nx = 47.5+ = 47.5+14.5= 62. 30\nTherefore, the mean of the marks obtained by the students is 62. The method discussed above is called the Assumed Mean Method. Activity 1 : From the Table 13.3 find the mean by taking each of x (i.e., 17.5, 32.5,\ni\nand so on) as ‘a’. What do you observe? You will find that the mean determined in\neach case is the same, i.e., 62. (Why ?)\nSo, we can say that the value of the mean obtained does not depend on the\nchoice of ‘a’. Observe that in Table 13.4, the values in Column 4 are all multiples of 15. So, if\nwe divide the values in the entire Column 4 by 15, we would get smaller numbers to\nmultiply with f. (Here, 15 is the class size of each class interval.)\ni\nx − a\nSo, let u = i , where a is the assumed mean and h is the class size. i h\nNow, we calculate u in this way and continue as before (i.e., find f u and\ni i i\nthen Σfu).

Further, we\ndiscussed finding the mode of ungrouped data. Here, we shall discuss ways of obtaining\na mode of grouped data. It is possible that more than one value may have the same\nmaximum frequency. In such situations, the data is said to be multimodal. Though\ngrouped data can also be multimodal, we shall restrict ourselves to problems having a\nsingle mode only. Let us first recall how we found the mode for ungrouped data through the following\nexample. Example 4 : The wickets taken by a bowler in 10 cricket matches are as follows:\n2 6 4 5 0 2 1 3 2 3\nFind the mode of the data. Solution : Let us form the frequency distribution table of the given data as follows:\nNumber of 0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nwickets\nNumber of 1 1 3 2 1 1 1\nmatches\nReprint 2025-26\n184 MATHEMATICS\nClearly, 2 is the number of wickets taken by the bowler in the maximum number\n(i.e., 3) of matches. So, the mode of this data is 2. In a grouped frequency distribution, it is not possible to determine the mode by\nlooking at the frequencies. Here, we can only locate a class with the maximum\nfrequency, called the modal class. The mode is a value inside the modal class, and is\ngiven by the formula:\n f  f \nMode = l   1 0 h\n 2f 1  f 0  f 2 \nwhere l = lower limit of the modal class,\nh = size of the class interval (assuming all class sizes to be equal),\nf = frequency of the modal class,\n1\nf = frequency of the class preceding the modal class,\n0\nf = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class.", "2\nLet us consider the following examples to illustrate the use of this formula. Example 5 : A survey conducted on 20 households in a locality by a group of students\nresulted in the following frequency table for the number of family members in a\nhousehold:\nFamily size 1 - 3 3 - 5 5 - 7 7 - 9 9 - 11\nNumber of 7 8 2 2 1\nfamilies\nFind the mode of this data. Solution : Here the maximum class frequency is 8, and the class corresponding to this\nfrequency is 3 – 5. So, the modal class is 3 – 5. Now\nmodal class = 3 – 5, lower limit (l) of modal class = 3, class size (h) = 2\nfrequency ( f ) of the modal class = 8,\n1\nfrequency ( f ) of class preceding the modal class = 7,\n0\nfrequency ( f ) of class succeeding the modal class = 2. 2\nNow, let us substitute these values in the formula :\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 185\n f  f \nMode = l   1 0 h\n 2f 1  f 0  f 2 \n 8 7  2\n= 3  2 3 3.286\n28 7  2 7\nTherefore, the mode of the data above is 3.286. Example 6 : The marks distribution of 30 students in a mathematics examination are\ngiven in Table 13.3 of Example 1. Find the mode of this data. Also compare and\ninterpret the mode and the mean. Solution : Refer to Table 13.3 of Example 1. Since the maximum number of students\n(i.e., 7) have got marks in the interval 40 - 55, the modal class is 40 - 55. Therefore,\nthe lower limit (l) of the modal class = 40,\nthe class size (h) = 15,\nthe frequency (f ) of modal class = 7,\n1\nthe frequency (f ) of the class preceding the modal class = 3,\n0\nthe frequency (f ) of the class succeeding the modal class = 6. 2\nNow, using the formula:\n f  f \nMode = l  1 0 h,\n 2f 1  f 0  f 2 \n 7 3 \nwe get Mode = 40  15 = 52\n14  63\nSo, the mode marks is 52. Now, from Example 1, you know that the mean marks is 62. So, the maximum number of students obtained 52 marks, while on an average a\nstudent obtained 62 marks. Remarks :\n1. In Example 6, the mode is less than the mean. But for some other problems it may\nbe equal or more than the mean also. 2. It depends upon the demand of the situation whether we are interested in finding the\naverage marks obtained by the students or the average of the marks obtained by most\nReprint 2025-26\n186 MATHEMATICS\nof the students. In the first situation, the mean is required and in the second situation,\nthe mode is required. Activity 3 : Continuing with the same groups as formed in Activity 2 and the situations\nassigned to the groups. Ask each group to find the mode of the data.

Recall that for finding the\nmedian of ungrouped data, we first arrange the data values of the observations in\nn 1\nascending order. Then, if n is odd, the median is the  th observation. And, if n\n 2 \nn n \nis even, then the median will be the average of the thand the  1th observations. 2 2 \nSuppose, we have to find the median of the following data, which gives the\nmarks, out of 50, obtained by 100 students in a test :\nMarks obtained 20 29 28 33 42 38 43 25\nNumber of students 6 28 24 15 2 4 1 20\nFirst, we arrange the marks in ascending order and prepare a frequency table as\nfollows :\nTable 13.9\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Frequency)\n20 6\n25 20\n28 24\n29 28\n33 15\n38 4\n42 2\n43 1\nTotal 100\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 189\nn\nHere n = 100, which is even. The median will be the average of the th and the\n2\n n \n  1 th observations, i.e., the 50th and 51st observations.", "To find these\n 2 \nobservations, we proceed as follows:\nTable 13.10\nMarks obtained Number of students\n20 6\nupto 25 6 + 20 = 26\nupto 28 26 + 24 = 50\nupto 29 50 + 28 = 78\nupto 33 78 + 15 = 93\nupto 38 93 + 4 = 97\nupto 42 97 + 2 = 99\nupto 43 99 + 1 = 100\nNow we add another column depicting this information to the frequency table\nabove and name it as cumulative frequency column. Table 13.11\nMarks obtained Number of students Cumulative frequency\n20 6 6\n25 20 26\n28 24 50\n29 28 78\n33 15 93\n38 4 97\n42 2 99\n43 1 100\nReprint 2025-26\n190 MATHEMATICS\nFrom the table above, we see that:\n50th observaton is 28 (Why?)\n51st observation is 29\n28 + 29\nSo, Median = = 28.5\n2\nRemark : The part of Table 13.11 consisting Column 1 and Column 3 is known as\nCumulative Frequency Table. The median marks 28.5 conveys the information that\nabout 50% students obtained marks less than 28.5 and another 50% students obtained\nmarks more than 28.5. Now, let us see how to obtain the median of grouped data, through the following\nsituation. Consider a grouped frequency distribution of marks obtained, out of 100, by 53\nstudents, in a certain examination, as follows:\nTable 13.12\nMarks Number of students\n0 - 10 5\n10 - 20 3\n20 - 30 4\n30 - 40 3\n40 - 50 3\n50 - 60 4\n60 - 70 7\n70 - 80 9\n80 - 90 7\n90 - 100 8\nFrom the table above, try to answer the following questions:\nHow many students have scored marks less than 10? The answer is clearly 5. Reprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 191\nHow many students have scored less than 20 marks? Observe that the number\nof students who have scored less than 20 include the number of students who have\nscored marks from 0 - 10 as well as the number of students who have scored marks\nfrom 10 - 20. So, the total number of students with marks less than 20 is 5 + 3, i.e., 8. We say that the cumulative frequency of the class 10-20 is 8. Similarly, we can compute the cumulative frequencies of the other classes, i.e.,\nthe number of students with marks less than 30, less than 40, . . ., less than 100. We\ngive them in Table 13.13 given below:\nTable 13.13\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)\nLess than 10 5\nLess than 20 5 + 3 = 8\nLess than 30 8 + 4 = 12\nLess than 40 12 + 3 = 15\nLess than 50 15 + 3 = 18\nLess than 60 18 + 4 = 22\nLess than 70 22 + 7 = 29\nLess than 80 29 + 9 = 38\nLess than 90 38 + 7 = 45\nLess than 100 45 + 8 = 53\nThe distribution given above is called the cumulative frequency distribution of\nthe less than type. Here 10, 20, 30, . . . 100, are the upper limits of the respective\nclass intervals. We can similarly make the table for the number of students with scores, more\nthan or equal to 0, more than or equal to 10, more than or equal to 20, and so on. From\nTable 13.12, we observe that all 53 students have scored marks more than or equal to\n0. Since there are 5 students scoring marks in the interval 0 - 10, this means that there\nare 53 – 5 = 48 students getting more than or equal to 10 marks.", "Continuing in the\nsame manner, we get the number of students scoring 20 or above as 48 – 3 = 45, 30 or\nabove as 45 – 4 = 41, and so on, as shown in Table 13.14. Reprint 2025-26\n192 MATHEMATICS\nTable 13.14\nMarks obtained Number of students\n(Cumulative frequency)\nMore than or equal to 0 53\nMore than or equal to 10 53 – 5 = 48\nMore than or equal to 20 48 – 3 = 45\nMore than or equal to 30 45 – 4 = 41\nMore than or equal to 40 41 – 3 = 38\nMore than or equal to 50 38 – 3 = 35\nMore than or equal to 60 35 – 4 = 31\nMore than or equal to 70 31 – 7 = 24\nMore than or equal to 80 24 – 9 = 15\nMore than or equal to 90 15 – 7 = 8\nThe table above is called a cumulative frequency distribution of the more\nthan type. Here 0, 10, 20, . . ., 90 give the lower limits of the respective class intervals. Now, to find the median of grouped data, we can make use of any of these\ncumulative frequency distributions. Let us combine Tables 13.12 and 13.13 to get Table 13.15 given below:\nTable 13.15\nMarks Number of students (f) Cumulative frequency (cf)\n0 - 10 5 5\n10 - 20 3 8\n20 - 30 4 12\n30 - 40 3 15\n40 - 50 3 18\n50 - 60 4 22\n60 - 70 7 29\n70 - 80 9 38\n80 - 90 7 45\n90 - 100 8 53\nNow in a grouped data, we may not be able to find the middle observation by\nlooking at the cumulative frequencies as the middle observation will be some value in\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 193\na class interval. It is, therefore, necessary to find the value inside a class that divides\nthe whole distribution into two halves. But which class should this be? n\nTo find this class, we find the cumulative frequencies of all the classes and . 2\nWe now locate the class whose cumulative frequency is greater than (and nearest to)\nn n\n This is called the median class. In the distribution above, n = 53. So, = 26.5. 2 2\nNow 60 – 70 is the class whose cumulative frequency 29 is greater than (and nearest\nn\nto) , i.e., 26.5. 2\nTherefore, 60 – 70 is the median class. After finding the median class, we use the following formula for calculating the\nmedian.  n \n cf\n \n2\nMedian = l +    h,\n f \n \n \nwhere l = lower limit of median class,\nn = number of observations,\ncf = cumulative frequency of class preceding the median class,\nf = frequency of median class,\nh = class size (assuming class size to be equal). n\nSubstituting the values  26.5, l = 60, cf = 22, f = 7, h = 10\n2\nin the formula above, we get\n26.5  22\nMedian = 60    10\n 7 \n45\n= 60 +\n7\n= 66.4\nSo, about half the students have scored marks less than 66.4, and the other half have\nscored marks more than 66.4.

Solution : To calculate the median height, we need to find the class intervals and their\ncorresponding frequencies.", "The given distribution being of the less than type, 140, 145, 150, . . ., 165 give the\nupper limits of the corresponding class intervals. So, the classes should be below 140,\n140 - 145, 145 - 150, . . ., 160 - 165. Observe that from the given distribution, we find\nthat there are 4 girls with height less than 140, i.e., the frequency of class interval\nbelow 140 is 4. Now, there are 11 girls with heights less than 145 and 4 girls with\nheight less than 140. Therefore, the number of girls with height in the interval\n140 - 145 is 11 – 4 = 7. Similarly, the frequency of 145 - 150 is 29 – 11 = 18, for\n150 - 155, it is 40 – 29 = 11, and so on. So, our frequency distribution table with the\ngiven cumulative frequencies becomes:\nTable 13.16\nClass intervals Frequency Cumulative frequency\nBelow 140 4 4\n140 - 145 7 11\n145 - 150 18 29\n150 - 155 11 40\n155 - 160 6 46\n160 - 165 5 51\nReprint 2025-26\nSTATISTICS 195\nn 51\nNow n = 51.

The mean is the most frequently used measure of central tendency because it\ntakes into account all the observations, and lies between the extremes, i.e., the largest\nand the smallest observations of the entire data. It also enables us to compare two or\nmore distributions.", "For example, by comparing the average (mean) results of students\nof different schools of a particular examination, we can conclude which school has a\nbetter performance. However, extreme values in the data affect the mean. For example, the mean of\nclasses having frequencies more or less the same is a good representative of the data. But, if one class has frequency, say 2, and the five others have frequency 20, 25, 20,\n21, 18, then the mean will certainly not reflect the way the data behaves. So, in such\ncases, the mean is not a good representative of the data. In problems where individual observations are not important, and we wish to find\nout a ‘typical’ observation, the median is more appropriate, e.g., finding the typical\nproductivity rate of workers, average wage in a country, etc. These are situations\nwhere extreme values may be there. So, rather than the mean, we take the median as\na better measure of central tendency. In situations which require establishing the most frequent value or most popular\nitem, the mode is the best choice, e.g., to find the most popular T.V. programme being\nwatched, the consumer item in greatest demand, the colour of the vehicle used by\nmost of the people, etc. Remarks :\n1. There is a empirical relationship between the three measures of central tendency :\n3 Median = Mode + 2 Mean\n2. The median of grouped data with unequal class sizes can also be calculated.
