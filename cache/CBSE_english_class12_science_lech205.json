These biomolecules interact with each other\nand constitute the molecular logic of life processes. In\naddition, some simple molecules like vitamins and\nmineral salts also play an important role in the functions\nof organisms. Structures and functions of some of these\nbiomolecules are discussed in this Unit. 1111100000.....11111CCCCCaaaaarrrrrbbbbbooooohhhhhyyyyydddddrrrrraaaaattttteeeeesssss Carbohydrates are primarily produced by plants and form a very large\ngroup of naturally occurring organic compounds. Some common\nexamples of carbohydrates are cane sugar, glucose, starch, etc. Most of\nthem have a general formula, C (H O) , and were considered as hydrates\nx 2 y\nof carbon from where the name carbohydrate was derived. For example,\nthe molecular formula of glucose (C H O ) fits into this general formula,\n6 12 6\nC (H O) . But all the compounds which fit into this formula may not be\n6 2 6\nclassified as carbohydrates. For example acetic acid (CH COOH) fits into\n3\nthis general formula, C (H O) but is not a carbohydrate. Similarly,\n2 2 2\nrhamnose, C H O is a carbohydrate but does not fit in this definition. 6 12 5\nA large number of their reactions have shown that they contain specific\nfunctional groups. Chemically, the carbohydrates may be defined as\noptically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or the compounds\nwhich produce such units on hydrolysis. Some of the carbohydrates,\nwhich are sweet in taste, are also called sugars. The most common\nsugar, used in our homes is named as sucrose whereas the sugar present\nReprint 2025-26\nin milk is known as lactose. Carbohydrates are also called saccharides\n(Greek: sakcharon means sugar). Carbohydrates are classified on the basis of their behaviour on\nhydrolysis. They have been broadly divided into following three groups.", "10.1.1 (i) Monosaccharides: A carbohydrate that cannot be hydrolysed further\nClassification of to give simpler unit of polyhydroxy aldehyde or ketone is called a\nCarbohydrates monosaccharide. About 20 monosaccharides are known to occur in\nnature. Some common examples are glucose, fructose, ribose, etc. (ii) Oligosaccharides: Carbohydrates that yield two to ten\nmonosaccharide units, on hydrolysis, are called oligosaccharides. They\nare further classified as disaccharides, trisaccharides, tetrasaccharides,\netc., depending upon the number of monosaccharides, they provide\non hydrolysis. Amongst these the most common are disaccharides. The two monosaccharide units obtained on hydrolysis of a disaccharide\nmay be same or different. For example, one molecule of sucrose on\nhydrolysis gives one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose\nwhereas maltose gives two molecules of only glucose. (iii) Polysaccharides: Carbohydrates which yield a large number of\nmonosaccharide units on hydrolysis are called polysaccharides. Some common examples are starch, cellulose, glycogen, gums,\netc. Polysaccharides are not sweet in taste, hence they are also\ncalled non-sugars. The carbohydrates may also be classified as either reducing or non-\nreducing sugars. All those carbohydrates which reduce Fehling’s\nsolution and Tollens’ reagent are referred to as reducing sugars. All\nmonosaccharides whether aldose or ketose are reducing sugars. 10.1.2 Monosaccharides are further classified on the basis of number of carbon\nMonosaccharides atoms and the functional group present in them. If a monosaccharide\ncontains an aldehyde group, it is known as an aldose and if it contains\na keto group, it is known as a ketose. Number of carbon atoms\nconstituting the monosaccharide is also introduced in the name as is\nevident from the examples given in Table 10.1\nTable 10.1: Different Types of Monosaccharides\nCarbon atoms General term Aldehyde Ketone\n3 Triose Aldotriose Ketotriose\n4 Tetrose Aldotetrose Ketotetrose\n5 Pentose Aldopentose Ketopentose\n6 Hexose Aldohexose Ketohexose\n7 Heptose Aldoheptose Ketoheptose\n10.1.2.1 Glucose Glucose occurs freely in nature as well as in the combined form. It is\npresent in sweet fruits and honey. Ripe grapes also contain glucose\nin large amounts. It is prepared as follows:\nPreparation of 1.

It should be remembered that\n‘D’ and ‘L’ have no relation with the optical activity of the compound. They are also not related to letter ‘d’ and ‘l’ (see Unit 6). The meaning\nof D– and L– notations is as follows. The letters ‘D’ or ‘L’ before the name of any compound indicate the\nrelative configuration of a particular stereoisomer of a compound with\nrespect to configuration of some other compound, configuration of\nwhich is known. In the case of carbohydrates, this refers to their\nrelation with a particular isomer of glyceraldehyde. Glyceraldehyde\ncontains one asymmetric carbon atom and exists in two enantiomeric\nforms as shown below. (+) Isomer of glyceraldehyde has ‘D’ configuration. It means that when\nits structural formula is written on paper following specific conventions\nwhich you will study in higher classes, the –OH group lies on right hand\nside in the structure.", "All those compounds which can be chemically\ncorrelated to D (+) isomer of glyceraldehyde are said to have D-\nconfiguration whereas those which can be correlated to ‘L’ (–) isomer of\nglyceraldehyde are said to have L—configuration. In L (–) isomer –OH\ngroup is on left hand side as you can see in the structure. For assigning\nChemistry 284\nReprint 2025-26\nthe configuration of monosaccharides, it is the lowest asymmetric carbon\natom (as shown below) which is compared. As in (+) glucose, —OH on\nthe lowest asymmetric carbon is on the right side which is comparable\nto (+) glyceraldehyde, so (+) glucose is assigned D-configuration. Other\nasymmetric carbon atoms of glucose are not considered for this\ncomparison. Also, the structure of glucose and glyceraldehyde is written\nin a way that most oxidised carbon (in this case –CHO)is at the top.

Despite having the aldehyde group, glucose does not give Schiff’s\ntest and it does not form the hydrogensulphite addition product with\nNaHSO . 3\n2. The pentaacetate of glucose does not react with hydroxylamine\nindicating the absence of free —CHO group. 3. Glucose is found to exist in two different crystalline forms which are\nnamed as a and b. The a-form of glucose (m.p. 419 K) is obtained by\ncrystallisation from concentrated solution of glucose at 303 K while\nthe b-form (m.p. 423 K) is obtained by crystallisation from hot and\nsaturated aqueous solution at 371 K. This behaviour could not be explained by the open chain structure\n(I) for glucose. It was proposed that one of the —OH groups may add\nto the —CHO group and form a cyclic hemiacetal structure. It was\nfound that glucose forms a six-membered ring in which —OH at C-5\nis involved in ring formation. This explains the absence of —CHO\ngroup and also existence of glucose in two forms as shown below. These two cyclic forms exist in equilibrium with open chain structure. The two cyclic hemiacetal forms of glucose differ only in the\nconfiguration of the hydroxyl group at C1, called anomeric carbon\n285 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n(the aldehyde carbon before cyclisation). Such isomers, i.e., a-form\nand b-form, are called anomers. The six membered cyclic structure\nof glucose is called pyranose structure (a– or b–), in analogy with\npyran. Pyran is a cyclic organic compound with one oxygen atom\nand five carbon atoms in the ring. The cyclic structure of glucose is\nmore correctly represented by Haworth structure as given below. 10.1.2.2 Fructose Fructose is an important ketohexose. It is obtained along with glucose\nby the hydrolysis of disaccharide, sucrose. It is a natural\nmonosaccharide found in fruits, honey and vegetables. In its pure\nform it is used as a sweetner. It is also an important ketohexose.", "Fructose also has the molecular formula C H O and\n6 12 6\nStructure on the basis of its reactions it was found to contain a\nof Fructose ketonic functional group at carbon number 2 and six\ncarbons in straight chain as in the case of glucose. It\nbelongs to D-series and is a laevorotatory compound. It is appropriately written as D-(–)-fructose. Its open\nchain structure is as shown. It also exists in two cyclic forms which are obtained\nby the addition of —OH at C5 to the ( ) group. The ring, thus formed\nis a five membered ring and is named as furanose with analogy to the\ncompound furan. Furan is a five membered cyclic compound with one\noxygen and four carbon atoms. The cyclic structures of two anomers of fructose are represented by\nHaworth structures as given. Chemistry 286\nReprint 2025-26\n10.1.3 You have already read that disaccharides on hydrolysis with dilute\nDisaccharides acids or enzymes yield two molecules of either the same or different\nmonosaccharides. The two monosaccharides are joined together by an\noxide linkage formed by the loss of a water molecule. Such a linkage\nbetween two monosaccharide units through oxygen atom is called\nglycosidic linkage. In disaccharides, if the reducing groups of monosaccharides i.e.,\naldehydic or ketonic groups are bonded, these are non-reducing sugars,\ne.g., sucrose. On the other hand, sugars in which these functional groups\nare free, are called reducing sugars, for example, maltose and lactose. (i) Sucrose: One of the common disaccharides is sucrose which on\nhydrolysis gives equimolar mixture of D-(+)-glucose and D-(-) fructose. These two monosaccharides are held together by a glycosidic\nlinkage between C1 of a-D-glucose and C2 of b-D-fructose. Since\nthe reducing groups of glucose and fructose are involved in\nglycosidic bond formation, sucrose is a non reducing sugar. Sucrose is dextrorotatory but after hydrolysis gives\ndextrorotatory glucose and laevorotatory fructose. Since the\nlaevorotation of fructose (–92.4°) is more than dextrorotation of\nglucose (+ 52.5°), the mixture is laevorotatory. Thus, hydrolysis of\nsucrose brings about a change in the sign of rotation, from dextro\n(+) to laevo (–) and the product is named as invert sugar. (ii) Maltose: Another disaccharide, maltose is composed of two\na-D-glucose units in which C1 of one glucose (I) is linked to C4\nof another glucose unit (II). The free aldehyde group can be\nproduced at C1 of second glucose in solution and it shows reducing\nproperties so it is a reducing sugar. 287 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\n(iii) Lactose: It is more commonly known as milk sugar since this\ndisaccharide is found in milk. It is composed of b-D-galactose and\nb-D-glucose. The linkage is between C1 of galactose and C4 of\nglucose. Free aldehyde group may be produced at C-1 of glucose\nunit, hence it is also a reducing sugar. 10.1.4\nPolysaccharides Polysaccharides contain a large number of monosaccharide units joined\ntogether by glycosidic linkages.", "These are the most commonly\nencountered carbohydrates in nature. They mainly act as the food\nstorage or structural materials. (i) Starch: Starch is the main storage polysaccharide of plants. It is\nthe most important dietary source for human beings. High content\nof starch is found in cereals, roots, tubers and some vegetables. It\nis a polymer of a-glucose and consists of two components—\nAmylose and Amylopectin. Amylose is water soluble component\nwhich constitutes about 15-20% of starch. Chemically amylose is\na long unbranched chain with 200-1000 a-D-(+)-glucose units\nheld together by C1– C4 glycosidic linkage. Amylopectin is insoluble in water and constitutes about 80-\n85% of starch. It is a branched chain polymer of a-D-glucose\nunits in which chain is formed by C1–C4 glycosidic linkage whereas\nbranching occurs by C1–C6 glycosidic linkage. Chemistry 288\nReprint 2025-26\n(ii) Cellulose: Cellulose occurs exclusively in plants and it is the most\nabundant organic substance in plant kingdom. It is a predominant\nconstituent of cell wall of plant cells. Cellulose is a straight chain\npolysaccharide composed only of b-D-glucose units which are\njoined by glycosidic linkage between C1 of one glucose unit and\nC4 of the next glucose unit. (iii) Glycogen: The carbohydrates are stored in animal body as glycogen. It is also known as animal starch because its structure is similar to\namylopectin and is rather more highly branched. It is present in liver,\nmuscles and brain. When the body needs glucose, enzymes break the\nglycogen down to glucose. Glycogen is also found in yeast and fungi. 10.1.5 Carbohydrates are essential for life in both plants and animals. They\nImportance of form a major portion of our food. Honey has been used for a long time\nCarbohydrates as an instant source of energy by ‘Vaids’ in ayurvedic system of\nmedicine.

They provide raw materials for many important industries like textiles,\npaper, lacquers and breweries. Two aldopentoses viz. D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribose (Section\n10.5.1, Class XII) are present in nucleic acids. Carbohydrates are found\nin biosystem in combination with many proteins and lipids.

They are also required for\ngrowth and maintenance of body. The word protein is derived from\nGreek word, “proteios” which means primary or of prime importance. All proteins are polymers of a-amino acids. 10.2.1 Amino Amino acids contain amino (–NH 2) and carboxyl (–COOH) functional\ngroups. Depending upon the relative position of amino group with\nAcids\nrespect to carboxyl group, the amino acids can be\nR CH COOH\nclassified as a, b, g, d and so on.

Amino Acids Equal number of amino and carboxyl groups makes it neutral; more\nnumber of amino than carboxyl groups makes it basic and more\ncarboxyl groups as compared to amino groups makes it acidic. The\namino acids, which can be synthesised in the body, are known as non-\nessential amino acids. On the other hand, those which cannot be\nsynthesised in the body and must be obtained through diet, are known\nas essential amino acids (marked with asterisk in Table10.2). 291 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nAmino acids are usually colourless, crystalline solids. These are\nwater-soluble, high melting solids and behave like salts rather than\nsimple amines or carboxylic acids.", "This behaviour is due to the presence\nof both acidic (carboxyl group) and basic (amino\ngroup) groups in the same molecule. In aqueous\nsolution, the carboxyl group can lose a proton\nand amino group can accept a proton, giving rise\nto a dipolar ion known as zwitter ion. This is\nneutral but contains both positive and negative\ncharges. In zwitter ionic form, amino acids show amphoteric behaviour as\nthey react both with acids and bases. Except glycine, all other naturally occurring a-amino acids are\noptically active, since the a-carbon atom is asymmetric. These exist\nboth in ‘D’ and ‘L’ forms. Most naturally occurring amino acids have\nL-configuration. L-Aminoacids are represented by writing the –NH group\n2\non left hand side. 10.2.3 Structure You have already read that proteins are the polymers of a-amino acids\nof Proteins and they are connected to each other by peptide bond or peptide\nlinkage. Chemically, peptide linkage is an amide formed between\n–COOH group and –NH group. The reaction between two molecules of\n2\nsimilar or different amino acids, proceeds through\nthe combination of the amino group of one molecule\nwith the carboxyl group of the other. This results in\nthe elimination of a water molecule and formation of\na peptide bond –CO–NH–. The product of the reaction\nis called a dipeptide because it is made up of two\namino acids. For example, when carboxyl group of\nglycine combines with the amino group of alanine\nwe get a dipeptide, glycylalanine. If a third amino acid combines to a dipeptide, the product is called a\ntripeptide. A tripeptide contains three amino acids linked by two peptide\nlinkages. Similarly when four, five or six amino acids are linked, the respective\nproducts are known as tetrapeptide, pentapeptide or hexapeptide,\nrespectively. When the number of such amino acids is more than ten, then\nthe products are called polypeptides. A polypeptide with more than hundred\namino acid residues, having molecular mass higher than 10,000u is called\na protein. However, the distinction between a polypeptide and a protein is\nnot very sharp. Polypeptides with fewer amino acids are likely to be called\nproteins if they ordinarily have a well defined conformation of a protein such\nas insulin which contains 51 amino acids. Proteins can be classified into two types on the basis of their\nmolecular shape. (a) Fibrous proteins\nWhen the polypeptide chains run parallel and are held together by\nhydrogen and disulphide bonds, then fibre– like structure is formed. Such\nproteins are generally insoluble in water. Some common examples are\nkeratin (present in hair, wool, silk) and myosin (present in muscles), etc. Chemistry 292\nReprint 2025-26\n(b) Globular proteins\nThis structure results when the chains of polypeptides coil around\nto give a spherical shape. These are usually soluble in water. Insulin\nand albumins are the common examples of globular proteins.", "Structure and shape of proteins can be studied at four different\nlevels, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary, each level\nbeing more complex than the previous one. (i) Primary structure of proteins: Proteins may have\none or more polypeptide chains. Each polypeptide in a\nprotein has amino acids linked with each other in a\nspecific sequence and it is this sequence of amino acids\nthat is said to be the primary structure of that protein. Any change in this primary structure i.e., the sequence\nof amino acids creates a different protein. (ii) Secondary structure of proteins: The secondary\nstructure of protein refers to the shape in which a long\npolypeptide chain can exist. They are found to exist in\ntwo different types of structures viz. a-helix and\nb-pleated sheet structure. These structures arise due\nto the regular folding of the backbone of the polypeptide\nchain due to hydrogen bonding between and\n–NH– groups of the peptide bond. a-Helix is one of the most common ways in which\na polypeptide chain forms all possible hydrogen bonds\nby twisting into a right handed screw (helix) with the\n–NH group of each amino acid residue hydrogen bonded to the\nFig. 10.1: a-Helix\nstructure of proteins C O of an adjacent turn of the helix as shown in Fig.10.1. In b-pleated sheet structure all peptide chains are\nstretched out to nearly maximum extension and then\nlaid side by side which are held together by\nintermolecular hydrogen bonds. The structure resembles\nthe pleated folds of drapery and therefore is known as\nb-pleated sheet. (iii)Tertiary structure of proteins: The tertiary\nstructure of proteins represents overall folding of the\npolypeptide chains i.e., further folding of the secondary\nstructure. It gives rise to two major molecular shapes\nviz. fibrous and globular. The main forces which\nstabilise the 2° and 3° structures of proteins are\nhydrogen bonds, disulphide linkages, van der Waals\nand electrostatic forces of attraction. Fig. 10.2: b-Pleated sheet structure of (iv) Quaternary structure of proteins: Some of the\nproteins proteins are composed of two or more polypeptide\nchains referred to as sub-units. The spatial\narrangement of these subunits with respect to each\nother is known as quaternary structure. 293 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nA diagrammatic representation of all these four structures is\ngiven in Figure 10.3 where each coloured ball represents an\namino acid.

An example is the digestion of food, absorption of\nappropriate molecules and ultimately production of energy. This process\ninvolves a sequence of reactions and all these reactions occur in the\nbody under very mild conditions. This occurs with the help of certain\nbiocatalysts called enzymes. Almost all the enzymes are globular\nproteins. Enzymes are very specific for a particular reaction and for a\nparticular substrate. They are generally named after the compound or\nclass of compounds upon which they work. For example, the enzyme\nthat catalyses hydrolysis of maltose into glucose is named as maltase.

Different vitamins belong\nto various chemical classes and it is difficult to define them on the\nbasis of structure.", "They are generally regarded as organic compounds\nrequired in the diet in small amounts to perform specific\nbiological functions for normal maintenance of optimum growth\n295 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nand health of the organism. Vitamins are designated by alphabets\nA, B, C, D, etc. Some of them are further named as sub-groups e.g. B ,\n1\nB , B , B , etc. Excess of vitamins is also harmful and vitamin pills\n2 6 12\nshould not be taken without the advice of doctor. The term “Vitamine” was coined from the word vital + amine since\nthe earlier identified compounds had amino groups. Later work showed\nthat most of them did not contain amino groups, so the letter ‘e’ was\ndropped and the term vitamin is used these days. 10.4.1 Vitamins are classified into two groups depending upon their solubility\nClassification of in water or fat. Vitamins (i) Fat soluble vitamins: Vitamins which are soluble in fat and oils\nbut insoluble in water are kept in this group. These are vitamins A,\nD, E and K. They are stored in liver and adipose (fat storing) tissues. (ii) Water soluble vitamins: B group vitamins and vitamin C are soluble\nin water so they are grouped together. Water soluble vitamins must\nbe supplied regularly in diet because they are readily excreted in\nurine and cannot be stored (except vitamin B ) in our body. 12\nSome important vitamins, their sources and diseases caused by\ntheir deficiency are listed in Table 10.3.

How are these characteristics transmitted from one\ngeneration to the next? It has been observed that nucleus of a living\ncell is responsible for this transmission of inherent characters, also\ncalled heredity.", "The particles in nucleus of the cell, responsible for\nheredity, are called chromosomes which are made up of proteins and\nanother type of biomolecules called nucleic acids. These are mainly\nof two types, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid\n(RNA). Since nucleic acids are long chain polymers of nucleotides, so\nthey are also called polynucleotides. James Dewey Watson\nBorn in Chicago, Illinois, in 1928, Dr Watson received his Ph.D. (1950) from Indiana University in Zoology. He is best known for\nhis discovery of the structure of DNA for which he shared with\nFrancis Crick and Maurice Wilkins the 1962 Nobel prize in\nPhysiology and Medicine. They proposed that DNA molecule takes\nthe shape of a double helix, an elegantly simple structure that\nresembles a gently twisted ladder. The rails of the ladder are\nmade of alternating units of phosphate and the sugar deoxyribose;\nthe rungs are each composed of a pair of purine/ pyrimidine bases. This\nresearch laid the foundation for the emerging field of molecular biology. The\ncomplementary pairing of nucleotide bases explains how identical copies of\nparental DNA pass on to two daughter cells. This research launched a revolution\nin biology that led to modern recombinant DNA techniques. 10.5.1 Chemical Complete hydrolysis of DNA (or RNA) yields a pentose sugar, phosphoric\nComposition acid and nitrogen containing heterocyclic compounds (called bases). In\nof Nucleic DNA molecules, the sugar moiety is b-D-2-deoxyribose whereas in\nAcids RNA molecule, it is b-D-ribose. 297 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nDNA contains four bases viz. adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C)\nand thymine (T). RNA also contains four bases, the first three bases are\nsame as in DNA but the fourth one is uracil (U). Cytosine (C) Thymine (T) Uracil (U)\n10.5.2 Structure A unit formed by the attachment of a base to 1¢ position of sugar is\nof Nucleic known as nucleoside. In nucleosides, the sugar carbons are numbered\nAcids as 1¢, 2¢, 3¢, etc. in order to distinguish these from the bases\n(Fig. 10.5a). When nucleoside is linked to phosphoric acid at 5¢-position\nof sugar moiety, we get a nucleotide (Fig. 10.5). Fig. 10.5: Structure of (a) a nucleoside and (b) a nucleotide\nNucleotides are joined together by phosphodiester linkage between\n5¢ and 3¢ carbon atoms of the pentose sugar. The formation of a typical\ndinucleotide is shown in Fig. 10.6. Chemistry 298\nReprint 2025-26\nFig. 10.6: Formation of a dinucleotide\nA simplified version of nucleic acid chain is as shown below. Base Base Base\nSugar Phosphate Sugar Phosphate Sugar\nn\nInformation regarding the sequence of nucleotides in the chain\nof a nucleic acid is called its primary structure. Nucleic acids\nhave a secondary structure also. James Watson and Francis Crick\ngave a double strand helix structure for DNA (Fig. 10.7). Two\nnucleic acid chains are wound about each other and held together\nby hydrogen bonds between pairs of bases.", "The two strands are\ncomplementary to each other because the hydrogen bonds are\nformed between specific pairs of bases. Adenine forms hydrogen\nbonds with thymine whereas cytosine forms hydrogen bonds\nwith guanine. In secondary structure of RNA single stranded helics is present\nwhich sometimes foldsback on itself. RNA molecules are of three\ntypes and they perform different functions. They are named as\nmessenger RNA (m-RNA), ribosomal RNA (r-RNA) and transfer\nRNA (t-RNA).

He obtained his M.Sc. degree from Punjab University in Lahore. He worked with Professor\nVladimir Prelog, who moulded Khorana’s thought and philosophy\ntowards science, work and effort. After a brief stay in India in\n1949, Khorana went back to England and worked with Professor\nG.W. Kenner and Professor A.R.Todd. It was at Cambridge, U.K. that he got interested in both proteins and nucleic acids. Dr Khorana shared the\nNobel Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with Marshall Nirenberg and Robert\nHolley for cracking the genetic code. DNA Fingerprinting\nIt is known that every individual has unique fingerprints. These occur at the tips of\nthe fingers and have been used for identification for a long time but these can be\naltered by surgery. A sequence of bases on DNA is also unique for a person and\ninformation regarding this is called DNA fingerprinting. It is same for every cell and\ncannot be altered by any known treatment. DNA fingerprinting is now used\n(i) in forensic laboratories for identification of criminals. (ii) to determine paternity of an individual. (iii) to identify the dead bodies in any accident by comparing the DNA’s of parents or\nchildren. (iv) to identify racial groups to rewrite biological evolution. 10.5.3 Biological DNA is the chemical basis of heredity and may be regarded as the reserve\nFunctions of genetic information. DNA is exclusively responsible for maintaining\nof Nucleic the identity of different species of organisms over millions of years. A\nAcids DNA molecule is capable of self duplication during cell division and\nidentical DNA strands are transferred to daughter cells. Another important\nfunction of nucleic acids is the protein synthesis in the cell. Actually, the\nproteins are synthesised by various RNA molecules in the cell but the\nmessage for the synthesis of a particular protein is present in DNA. 1111100000.....66666 HHHHHooooorrrrrmmmmmooooonnnnneeeeesssss Hormones are molecules that act as intercellular messengers. These\nare produced by endocrine glands in the body and are poured directly\nin the blood stream which transports them to the site of action. In terms of chemical nature, some of these are steroids, e.g., estrogens\nand androgens; some are poly peptides for example insulin and\nendorphins and some others are amino acid derivatives such as\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.", "Hormones have several functions in the body. They help to maintain\nthe balance of biological activities in the body. The role of insulin in keeping\nthe blood glucose level within the narrow limit is an example of this\nfunction. Insulin is released in response to the rapid rise in blood glucose\nlevel. On the other hand hormone glucagon tends to increase the glucose\nlevel in the blood. The two hormones together regulate the glucose level\nin the blood. Epinephrine and norepinephrine mediate responses to\nexternal stimuli. Growth hormones and sex hormones play role in growth\nand development. Thyroxine produced in the thyroid gland is an iodinated\nderivative of amino acid tyrosine. Abnormally low level of thyroxine leads\nChemistry 300\nReprint 2025-26\nto hypothyroidism which is characterised by lethargyness and obesity. Increased level of thyroxine causes hyperthyroidism. Low level of iodine\nin the diet may lead to hypothyroidism and enlargement of the thyroid\ngland. This condition is largely being controlled by adding sodium iodide\nto commercial table salt (“Iodised” salt). Steroid hormones are produced by adrenal cortex and gonads (testes\nin males and ovaries in females). Hormones released by the adrenal cortex\nplay very important role in the functions of the body. For example,\nglucocorticoids control the carbohydrate metabolism, modulate\ninflammatory reactions, and are involved in reactions to stress. The\nmineralocorticoids control the level of excretion of water and salt by the\nkidney. If adrenal cortex does not function properly then one of the results\nmay be Addison’s disease characterised by hypoglycemia, weakness and\nincreased susceptibility to stress. The disease is fatal unless it is treated by\nglucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Hormones released by gonads are\nresponsible for development of secondary sex characters. Testosterone is\nthe major sex hormone produced in males. It is responsible for development\nof secondary male characteristics (deep voice, facial hair, general physical\nconstitution) and estradiol is the main female sex hormone. It is responsible\nfor development of secondary female characteristics and participates in\nthe control of menstrual cycle. Progesterone is responsible for preparing\nthe uterus for implantation of fertilised egg.

What does this fact suggest about the structure of RNA? SSSSSuuuuummmmmmmmmmaaaaarrrrryyyyy\nCarbohydrates are optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones or molecules which\nprovide such units on hydrolysis. They are broadly classified into three groups —\nmonosaccharides, disaccharides and polysaccharides.", "Glucose, the most important\nsource of energy for mammals, is obtained by the digestion of starch. Monosaccharides\nare held together by glycosidic linkages to form disaccharides or polysaccharides. Proteins are the polymers of about twenty different aaaaa-amino acids which are\nlinked by peptide bonds. Ten amino acids are called essential amino acids because\nthey cannot be synthesised by our body, hence must be provided through diet. Proteins\nperform various structural and dynamic functions in the organisms. Proteins which\ncontain only a-amino acids are called simple proteins. The secondary or tertiary\nstructure of proteins get disturbed on change of pH or temperature and they are not\nable to perform their functions. This is called denaturation of proteins. Enzymes are\nbiocatalysts which speed up the reactions in biosystems. They are very specific and\nselective in their action and chemically majority of enzymes are proteins. Vitamins are accessory food factors required in the diet. They are classified as\nfat soluble (A, D, E and K) and water soluble (B group and C). Deficiency of vitamins\nleads to many diseases. 301 Biomolecules\nReprint 2025-26\nNucleic acids are the polymers of nucleotides which in turn consist of a base,\na pentose sugar and phosphate moiety. Nucleic acids are responsible for the transfer\nof characters from parents to offsprings. There are two types of nucleic acids —\nDNA and RNA. DNA contains a five carbon sugar molecule called 2-deoxyribose\nwhereas RNA contains ribose. Both DNA and RNA contain adenine, guanine and\ncytosine. The fourth base is thymine in DNA and uracil in RNA. The structure of\nDNA is a double strand whereas RNA is a single strand molecule. DNA is the\nchemical basis of heredity and have the coded message for proteins to be synthesised\nin the cell. There are three types of RNA — mRNA, rRNA and tRNA which actually\ncarry out the protein synthesis in the cell.
