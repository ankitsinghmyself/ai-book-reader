["3\nCHAPTER\nMetals and Non-metals\nIn Class IX you have learnt about various elements. You have seen\nthat elements can be classified as metals or non-metals on the basis of\ntheir properties. n Think of some uses of metals and non-metals in your daily life. n What properties did you think of while categorising elements\nas metals or non-metals? n How are these properties related to the uses of these elements? Let us look at some of these properties in detail. 33333.....11111 PPPPPHHHHHYYYYYSSSSSIIIIICCCCCAAAAALLLLL PPPPPRRRRROOOOOPPPPPEEEEERRRRRTTTTTIIIIIEEEEESSSSS\n3.1.1 Metals\nThe easiest way to start grouping substances is by comparing their\nphysical properties. Let us study this with the help of the following\nactivities. For performing Activities 3.1 to 3.6, collect the samples of\nfollowing metals – iron, copper, aluminium, magnesium, sodium, lead,\nzinc and any other metal that is easily available. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....11111\nn Take samples of iron, copper, aluminium and magnesium. Note\nthe appearance of each sample. n Clean the surface of each sample by rubbing them with sand paper\nand note their appearance again. Metals, in their pure state, have a shining surface. This property is\ncalled metallic lustre. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....22222\nn Take small pieces of iron, copper, aluminium, and magnesium. Try to cut these metals with a sharp knife and note your\nobservations. n Hold a piece of sodium metal with a pair of tongs. CAUTION: Always handle sodium metal with care. Dry it by\npressing between the folds of a filter paper. n Put it on a watch-glass and try to cut it with a knife. n What do you observe? Reprint 2025-26\nYou will find that metals are generally hard. The hardness varies\nfrom metal to metal. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....33333\nn Take pieces of iron, zinc, lead and copper. n Place any one metal on a block of iron and strike it four or five\ntimes with a hammer. What do you observe? n Repeat with other metals. n Record the change in the shape of these metals. You will find that some metals can be beaten into thin sheets. This\nproperty is called malleability. Did you know that gold and silver are the\nmost malleable metals? AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....44444\nn List the metals whose wires you have seen in daily life. The ability of metals to be drawn into thin wires is called ductility. Gold is the most ductile metal. You will be surprised to know that a wire\nof about 2 km length can be drawn from one gram of gold. It is because of their malleability and ductility that metals can be\ngiven different shapes according to our needs. Can you name some metals that are used for making cooking vessels? Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels? Let us do\nthe following Activity to find out the answer. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....55555\nn Take an aluminium or copper\nwire. Clamp this wire on a\nstand, as shown in Fig.", "3.1. n Fix a pin to the free end of the\nwire using wax. n Heat the wire with a spirit lamp,\ncandle or a burner near the\nplace where it is clamped. n What do you observe after some\ntime? n Note your observations. Does\nthe metal wire melt? FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 33333.....11111\nMetals are good\nThe above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat\nconductors of heat. and have high melting points. The best conductors of heat are silver and\ncopper. Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat. Do metals also conduct electricity? Let us find out. 38 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....66666\nn Set up an electric circuit as shown in Fig. 3.2. n Place the metal to be tested in the circuit\nbetween terminals A and B as shown. n Does the bulb glow? What does this indicate? You must have seen that the wires that carry current\nin your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride (PVC)\nor a rubber-like material. Why are electric wires coated FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 33333.....22222\nwith such substances? Metals are good\nWhat happens when metals strike a hard surface? Do they produce conductors of electricity. a sound? The metals that produce a sound on striking a hard surface\nare said to be sonorous. Can you now say why school bells are made of\nmetals? 3.1.2 Non-metals\nIn the previous Class you have learnt that there are very few non-metals\nas compared to metals. Some of the examples of non-metals are carbon,\nsulphur, iodine, oxygen, hydrogen, etc. The non-metals are either solids\nor gases except bromine which is a liquid. Do non-metals also have physical properties similar to that of metals? Let us find out. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....77777\nn Collect samples of carbon (coal or graphite), sulphur and iodine. n Carry out the Activities 3.1 to 3.4 and 3.6 with these non-metals\nand record your observations. Compile your observations regarding metals and non-metals in Table 3.1. Table 3.1\nElement Symbol Type of Hardness Malleability Ductility Conducts Sonority\nsurface Electricity\nOn the bases of the observations recorded in Table 3.1, discuss the\ngeneral physical properties of metals and non-metals in the class. You\nmust have concluded that we cannot group elements according to their\nphysical properties alone, as there are many exceptions. For example –\n(i) All metals except mercury exist as solids at room temperature. In Activity 3.5, you have observed that metals have high melting\nMetals and Non-metals 39\nReprint 2025-26\npoints but gallium and caesium have very low melting points. These two metals will melt if you keep them on your palm. (ii) Iodine is a non-metal but it is lustrous. (iii) Carbon is a non-metal that can exist in different forms. Each\nform is called an allotrope. Diamond, an allotrope of carbon, is\nthe hardest natural substance known and has a very high melting\nand boiling point. Graphite, another allotrope of carbon, is a\nconductor of electricity.", "(iv) Alkali metals (lithium, sodium, potassium) are so soft that they\ncan be cut with a knife. They have low densities and low melting\npoints. Elements can be more clearly classified as metals and non-metals\non the basis of their chemical properties. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....88888\nn Take a magnesium ribbon and some sulphur powder. n Burn the magnesium ribbon. Collect the ashes formed and dissolve\nthem in water. n Test the resultant solution with both red and blue litmus paper. n Is the product formed on burning magnesium acidic or basic? n Now burn sulphur powder. Place a test tube over the burning\nsulphur to collect the fumes produced. n Add some water to the above test tube and shake. n Test this solution with blue and red litmus paper. n Is the product formed on burning sulphur acidic or basic? n Can you write equations for these reactions? Most non-metals produce acidic oxides when dissolve in water. On\nthe other hand, most metals, give rise to basic oxides. You will be learning\nmore about these metal oxides in the next section. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. Give an example of a metal which\n(i) is a liquid at room temperature. (ii) can be easily cut with a knife. (iii) is the best conductor of heat. (iv) is a poor conductor of heat. 2. Explain the meanings of malleable and ductile. 33333.....22222 CCCCCHHHHHEEEEEMMMMMIIIIICCCCCAAAAALLLLL PPPPPRRRRROOOOOPPPPPEEEEERRRRRTTTTTIIIIIEEEEESSSSS OOOOOFFFFF MMMMMEEEEETTTTTAAAAALLLLLSSSSS\nWe will learn about the chemical properties of metals in the following\nSections 3.2.1 to 3.2.4. For this, collect the samples of following metals –\naluminium, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, zinc and sodium. 40 Science\nReprint 2025-26\n3.2.1 What happens when Metals are burnt in Air? You have seen in Activity 3.8 that magnesium burns in air with a dazzling\nwhite flame. Do all metals react in the same manner? Let us check by\nperforming the following Activity. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....99999\nCAUTION: The following activity needs the teacher’s assistance. It would be better if students wear eye protection. n Hold any of the samples taken above with a pair of tongs and try\nburning over a flame. Repeat with the other metal samples. n Collect the product if formed. n Let the products and the metal surface cool down. n Which metals burn easily? n What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt? n How does the metal surface appear after burning? n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity\ntowards oxygen. n Are the products soluble in water? Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides. Metal + Oxygen → Metal oxide\nFor example, when copper is heated in air, it combines with oxygen\nto form copper(II) oxide, a black oxide. 2Cu + O → 2CuO\n2\n(Copper) (Copper(II) oxide)\nSimilarly, aluminium forms aluminium oxide. 4Al + 3O → 2Al O\n2 2 3\n(Aluminium) (Aluminium oxide)\nRecall from Chapter 2, how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid.", "We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature. But some metal\noxides, such as aluminium oxide, zinc oxide show both acidic as well as\nbasic behaviour. Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as\nbases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides. Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases –\nAl O + 6HCl → 2AlCl + 3H O\n2 3 3 2\nAl O + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO + H O\n2 3 2 2\n(Sodium\naluminate)\nMost metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve\nin water to form alkalis. Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in\nwater to produce alkalis as follows –\nNa O(s) + H O(l) → 2NaOH(aq)\n2 2\nK O(s) + H O(l) → 2KOH(aq)\n2 2\nMetals and Non-metals 41\nReprint 2025-26\nWe have observed in Activity 3.9 that all metals do not react with\noxygen at the same rate. Different metals show different reactivities\ntowards oxygen. Metals such as potassium and sodium react so\nvigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open. Hence, to protect them\nand to prevent accidental fires, they are kept immersed in kerosene oil. At ordinary temperature, the surfaces of metals such as magnesium,\naluminium, zinc, lead, etc., are covered with a thin layer of oxide. The\nprotective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation. Iron\ndoes not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled\nin the flame of the burner. Copper does not burn, but the hot metal is\ncoated with a black coloured layer of copper(II) oxide. Silver and gold do\nnot react with oxygen even at high temperatures. ?wonK\nAnodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium. Aluminium\ndevelops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air. This aluminium oxide coat makes it\nresistant to further corrosion. The resistance can be improved further by making the\nuoY oxide layer thicker. During anodising, a clean aluminium article is made the anode\nand is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid. The oxygen gas evolved at the anode\nreacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer. This oxide layer can\noD\nbe dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish. After performing Activity 3.9, you must have observed that sodium\nis the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here. The reaction of\nmagnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium. But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of\nzinc, iron, copper or lead. Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a\nconclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals. 3.2.2 What happens when Metals react with Water? AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....1111100000\nCAUTION: This Activity needs the teacher’s assistance. n Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 3.9. n Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers half-filled\nwith cold water. n Which metals reacted with cold water? Arrange them in the\nincreasing order of their reactivity with cold water.", "n Did any metal produce fire on water? n Does any metal start floating after some time? n Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers\nhalf-filled with hot water. n For the metals that did not react with hot water, arrange the\napparatus as shown in Fig. 3.3 and observe their reaction with steam. n Which metals did not react even with steam? n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water. 42 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 33333.....33333 Action of steam on a metal\nMetals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen\ngas. Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form\nmetal hydroxide. But all metals do not react with water. Metal + Water → Metal oxide + Hydrogen\nMetal oxide+ Water → Metal hydroxide\nMetals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water. In\ncase of sodium and potassium, the reaction is so violent and exothermic\nthat the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire. 2K(s) + 2H O(l) → 2KOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy\n2 2\n2Na(s) + 2H O(l) → 2NaOH(aq) + H (g) + heat energy\n2 2\nThe reaction of calcium with water is less violent. The heat evolved is\nnot sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire. Ca(s) + 2H O(l) → Ca(OH) (aq) + H (g)\n2 2 2\nCalcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed\nstick to the surface of the metal. Magnesium does not react with cold water. It reacts with hot water\nto form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen. It also starts floating due\nto the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface. Metals like aluminium, iron and zinc do not react either with cold or\nhot water. But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen. 2Al(s) + 3H O(g) → Al O (s) + 3H (g)\n2 2 3 2\n3Fe(s) + 4H O(g) → Fe O (s) + 4H (g)\n2 3 4 2\nMetals such as lead, copper, silver and gold do not react with water at all. 3.2.3 What happens when Metals react with Acids? You have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and\nhydrogen gas. Metals and Non-metals 43\nReprint 2025-26\nMetal + Dilute acid → Salt + Hydrogen\nBut do all metals react in the same manner? Let us find out. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....1111111111\nn Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again. If the samples are tarnished, rub them clean with sand paper. CAUTION: Do not take sodium and potassium as they react\nvigorously even with cold water. n Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute\nhydrochloric acid. n Suspend thermometers in the test tubes, so that their bulbs are\ndipped in the acid. n Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully. n Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid? n With which metal did you record the highest temperature? n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute\nacids. Write equations for the reactions of magnesium, aluminium, zinc\nand iron with dilute hydrochloric acid.", "Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid. It is\nbecause HNO is a strong oxidising agent. It oxidises the H produced to\n3 2\nwater and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides (N O, NO,\n2\nNO ). But magnesium (Mg) and manganese (Mn) react with very dilute\n2\nHNO to evolve H gas. 3 2\nYou must have observed in Activity 3.11, that the rate of formation\nof bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium. The reaction was\nalso the most exothermic in this case. The reactivity decreases in the\norder Mg > Al > Zn > Fe. In the case of copper, no bubbles were seen and\nthe temperature also remained unchanged. This shows that copper does\nnot react with dilute HCl. ?wonK\nAqua regia, (Latin for ‘royal water’) is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated\nhydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 3:1. It can dissolve\nuoY gold, even though neither of these acids can do so alone. Aqua regia is a highly\ncorrosive, fuming liquid. It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and\nplatinum. oD\n3.2.4 How do Metals react with Solutions of other Metal\nSalts? AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 33333.....1111122222\nn Take a clean wire of copper and an iron nail. n Put the copper wire in a solution of iron sulphate and the iron\nnail in a solution of copper sulphate taken in test tubes (Fig. 3.4). n Record your observations after 20 minutes. 44 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nn In which test tube did you find that a reaction has occurred? n On what basis can you say that a reaction has actually taken\nplace? n Can you correlate your observations for the Activities 3.9, 3.10\nand 3.11? n Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction that has taken\nplace. n Name the type of reaction. Reactive metals can displace less\nreactive metals from their compounds in\nsolution or molten form. We have seen in the previous sections\nthat all metals are not equally reactive. We\nchecked the reactivity of various metals\nwith oxygen, water and acids. But all\nmetals do not react with these reagents. So we were not able to put all the metal\nsamples we had collected in decreasing\norder of their reactivity.

In the above activities, you saw the reactions of metals with a number of\nreagents. Why do metals react in this manner? Let us recall what we\nlearnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX. We\nlearnt that noble gases, which have a completely filled valence shell, show\nlittle chemical activity. We, therefore, explain the reactivity of elements\nas a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell. Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and\nsome metals and non-metals. We can see from Table 3.3 that a sodium atom has one electron in its\noutermost shell. If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell\nnow becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet. The nucleus\nof this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has\nbecome 10, so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation\nNa+.", "On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell\n46 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 3.3 Electronic configurations of some elements\nType of Element Atomic Number of\nelement number electrons in shells\nK L M N\nNoble gases Helium (He) 2 2\nNeon (Ne) 10 2 8\nArgon (Ar) 18 2 8 8\nMetals Sodium (Na) 11 2 8 1\nMagnesium (Mg) 12 2 8 2\nAluminium (Al) 13 2 8 3\nPotassium (K) 19 2 8 8 1\nCalcium (Ca) 20 2 8 8 2\nNon-metals Nitrogen (N) 7 2 5\nOxygen (O) 8 2 6\nFluorine (F) 9 2 7\nPhosphorus (P) 15 2 8 5\nSulphur (S) 16 2 8 6\nChlorine (Cl) 17 2 8 7\nand it requires one more electron to complete its octet. If sodium and chlorine\nwere to react, the electron lost by sodium could be taken up by chlorine. After gaining an electron, the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge,\nbecause its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K, L\nand M shells. This gives us a chloride anion C1–.

These compounds are generally brittle and\nbreak into pieces when pressure is applied. (ii) Melting and Boiling points: Ionic compounds have high melting\nand boiling points (see Table 3.4). This is because a considerable\namount of energy is required to break the strong inter-ionic\nattraction. (iii) Solubility: Electrovalent compounds are generally soluble in\nwater and insoluble in solvents such as kerosene, petrol, etc. (iv) Conduction of Electricity: The conduction of electricity through\na solution involves the movement of charged particles. A solution\nof an ionic compound in water contains ions, which move to the\nopposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the\nsolution. Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct\nelectricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible\ndue to their rigid structure. But ionic compounds conduct\nelectricity in the molten state. This is possible in the molten state\nsince the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely\ncharged ions are overcome due to the heat.

Seawater also contains\nsome soluble salts such as sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, etc. The elements or compounds, which occur naturally in the earth’s crust,\nare known as minerals. At some places, minerals contain a very high\npercentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted\nfrom it. These minerals are called ores. 3.4.1 Extraction of Metals\nYou have learnt about the reactivity series of metals. Having this\nknowledge, you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its\nore. Some metals are found in the earth’s crust in the free state. Some\nare found in the form of their compounds. The metals at the bottom of\nthe activity series are the least reactive. They are often found in a free\nMetals and Non-metals 49\nReprint 2025-26\nK state. For example, gold, silver, platinum and copper are found in the\nfree state.", "Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as\nNa\ntheir sulphide or oxide ores. The metals at the top of the activity series\nElectrolysis\nCa (K, Na, Ca, Mg and Al) are so reactive that they are never found in\nnature as free elements. The metals in the middle of the activity series\nMg\n(Zn, Fe, Pb, etc.) are moderately reactive. They are found in the earth’s\nAl crust mainly as oxides, sulphides or carbonates. You will find that\nthe ores of many metals are oxides. This is because oxygen is a very\nZn reactive element and is very abundant on the earth. Thus on the basis of reactivity, we can group the metals into the\nFe\nReduction using following three categories (Fig. 3.9) – (i) Metals of low reactivity; (ii) Metals\ncarbon\nPb of medium reactivity; (iii) Metals of high reactivity. Different techniques\nare to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category. Cu\nSeveral steps are involved in the extraction of pure metal from\nores. A summary of these steps is given in Fig.3.10.

The impurities must\nbe removed from the ore prior to the extraction of the metal. The processes\n50 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nused for removing the gangue from the ore are based on the differences\nbetween the physical or chemical properties of the gangue and the ore. Different separation techniques are accordingly employed. 3.4.3 Extracting Metals Low in the Activity Series\nMetals low in the activity series are very unreactive. The oxides of these\nmetals can be reduced to metals by heating alone. For example, cinnabar\n(HgS) is an ore of mercury. When it is heated in air, it is first converted\ninto mercuric oxide (HgO).

These are usually present as sulphides\nor carbonates in nature. It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide, as\ncompared to its sulphides and carbonates. Therefore, prior to reduction,\nthe metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal\noxides. The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly\nin the presence of excess air. This process is known as roasting.", "The\ncarbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited\nair. This process is known as calcination. The chemical reaction that\ntakes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown\nas follows –\nRoasting\n(g)Heat→2ZnO(s)\n2ZnS(s) + 3O + 2SO (g)\n2 2\nCalcination\n(s)Heat→ZnO(s)\nZnCO + CO (g)\n3 2\nThe metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by\nusing suitable reducing agents such as carbon. For example, when zinc\noxide is heated with carbon, it is reduced to metallic zinc. ZnO(s) + C(s) → Zn(s) + CO(g)\nYou are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction\nexplained in the first Chapter. Obtaining metals from their compounds\nis also a reduction process. Besides using carbon (coke) to reduce metal oxides to metals,\nsometimes displacement reactions can also be used. The highly reactive\nmetals such as sodium, calcium, aluminium, etc., are used as reducing\nMetals and Non-metals 51\nReprint 2025-26\nagents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their\ncompounds.

They cannot\njoining railway tracks\nbe obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon. For example,\ncarbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium, magnesium, calcium,\naluminium, etc., to the respective metals. This is because these metals\nhave more affinity for oxygen than carbon. These metals are obtained\nby electrolytic reduction. For example, sodium, magnesium and calcium\nare obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides. The metals\nare deposited at the cathode (the negatively charged electrode), whereas,\nchlorine is liberated at the anode (the positively charged electrode). The\nreactions are –\nAt cathode Na+ + e– → Na\nAt anode 2Cl– → Cl + 2e–\n2\nSimilarly, aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of\naluminium oxide. 3.4.6 Refining of Metals\nThe metals produced by various reduction processes\ndescribed above are not very pure.

Metals and Non-metals 53\nReprint 2025-26\n3.5.1 Prevention of Corrosion\nThe rusting of iron can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing,\ngalvanising, chrome plating, anodising or making alloys. Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting\nby coating them with a thin layer of zinc. The galvanised article is\nprotected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken. Can you\nreason this out? Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal. We can get the desired properties by this method. For example, iron is\nthe most widely used metal. But it is never used in its pure state. This is\nbecause pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot. But, if it is\nmixed with a small amount of carbon (about 0.05 %), it becomes hard\nand strong. When iron is mixed with nickel and chromium, we get\nstainless steel, which is hard and does not rust. Thus, if iron is mixed\nwith some other substance, its properties change. In fact, the properties\nof any metal can be changed if it is mixed with some other substance. The substance added may be a metal or a non-metal. An alloy is a\nhomogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a non-\nmetal. It is prepared by first melting the primary metal, and then,\ndissolving the other elements in it in definite proportions. It is then cooled\nto room temperature. ?wonK\nPure gold, known as 24 carat gold, is very soft. It is, therefore, not suitable for making\njewellery. It is alloyed with either silver or copper to make it hard. Generally, in India,\nuoY\n22 carat gold is used for making ornaments. It means that 22 parts of pure gold is\nalloyed with 2 parts of either copper or silver. oD!wonK\nIf one of the metals is mercury, then the alloy is known as an\namalgam. The electrical conductivity and melting point of an alloy is\nless than that of pure metals. For example, brass, an alloy of copper and\nzinc (Cu and Zn), and bronze, an alloy of copper and tin (Cu and Sn), are\nnot good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making\nelectrical circuits. Solder, an alloy of lead and tin (Pb and Sn), has a low\nmelting point and is used for welding electrical wires together. The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy\nThe iron pillar near the Qutub Minar in Delhi was built more\nthan 1600 years ago by the iron workers of India.

These oxides are known\nas amphoteric oxides. n Different metals have different reactivities with water and dilute acids. n A list of common metals arranged in order of their decreasing reactivity is known\nas an activity series. n Metals above hydrogen in the Activity series can displace hydrogen from dilute\nacids. n A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution. n Metals occur in nature as free elements or in the form of their compounds. n The extraction of metals from their ores and then refining them for use is known\nas metallurgy. n An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals, or a metal and a\nnon-metal. n The surface of some metals, such as iron, is corroded when they are exposed to\nmoist air for a long period of time. This phenomenon is known as corrosion. n Non-metals have properties opposite to that of metals. They are neither malleable\nnor ductile. They are bad conductors of heat and electricity, except for graphite,\nwhich conducts electricity.
