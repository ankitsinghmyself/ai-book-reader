["5\nCHAPTER\nLife Processes\nHow do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not\nalive? If we see a dog running, or a cow chewing cud, or a man\nshouting loudly on the street, we know that these are living beings. What\nif the dog or the cow or the man were asleep? We would still think that\nthey were alive, but how did we know that? We see them breathing, and\nwe know that they are alive. What about plants? How do we know that\nthey are alive? We see them green, some of us will say. But what about\nplants that have leaves of colours other than green? They grow over\ntime, so we know that they are alive, some will say. In other words, we\ntend to think of some sort of movement, either growth-related or not, as\ncommon evidence for being alive. But a plant that is not visibly growing is\nstill alive, and some animals can breathe without visible movement. So\nusing visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough. Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye –\nmovements of molecules, for example. Is this invisible molecular\nmovement necessary for life? If we ask this question to professional\nbiologists, they will say yes. In fact, viruses do not show any molecular\nmovement in them (until they infect some cell), and that is partly why\nthere is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not. Why are molecular movements needed for life? We have seen in earlier\nclasses that living organisms are well-organised structures; they can\nhave tissues, tissues have cells, cells have smaller components in them,\nand so on. Because of the effects of the environment, this organised,\nordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down\nover time. If order breaks down, the organism will no longer be alive. So\nliving creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures. Since all these structures are made up of molecules, they must move\nmolecules around all the time. What are the maintenance processes in living organisms? Let us explore. 55555.....11111 WWWWWHHHHHAAAAATTTTT AAAAARRRRREEEEE LLLLLIIIIIFFFFFEEEEE PPPPPRRRRROOOOOCCCCCEEEEESSSSSSSSSSEEEEESSSSS????? The maintenance functions of living organisms must go on even when\nthey are not doing anything particular. Even when we are just sitting in\nReprint 2025-26\nclass, even if we are just asleep, this maintenance job has to go on. The processes which together perform this maintenance job are\nlife processes. Since these maintenance processes are needed to prevent damage\nand break-down, energy is needed for them. This energy comes from\noutside the body of the individual organism. So there must be a process\nto transfer a source of energy from outside the body of the organism,\nwhich we call food, to the inside, a process we commonly call nutrition. If the body size of the organisms is to grow, additional raw material will\nalso be needed from outside.", "Since life on earth depends on carbon-\nbased molecules, most of these food sources are also carbon-based. Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources, different\norganisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes. The outside sources of energy could be quite varied, since the\nenvironment is not under the control of the individual organism. These\nsources of energy, therefore, need to be broken down or built up in the\nbody, and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that\ncan be used for the various molecular movements needed for\nmaintaining living structures, as well as to the kind of molecules the\nbody needs to grow. For this, a series of chemical reactions in the\nbody are necessary. Oxidising-reducing reactions are some of the most\ncommon chemical means to break-down molecules. For this, many\norganisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body. The process\nof acquiring oxygen from outside the body, and to use it in the process\nof break-down of food sources for cellular needs, is what we call\nrespiration. In the case of a single-celled organism, no specific organs for taking\nin food, exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because\nthe entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment. But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and\nthe body design becomes more complex? In multi-cellular organisms,\nall the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding\nenvironment. Thus, simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of\nall the cells. We have seen previously how, in multi-cellular organisms, various\nbody parts have specialised in the functions they perform. We are familiar\nwith the idea of these specialised tissues, and with their organisation in\nthe body of the organism. It is therefore not surprising that the uptake\nof food and of oxygen will also be the function of specialised tissues. However, this poses a problem, since the food and oxygen are now taken\nup at one place in the body of the organisms, while all parts of the body\nneed them. This situation creates a need for a transportation system for\ncarrying food and oxygen from one place to another in the body. When chemical reactions use the carbon source and the oxygen for\nenergy generation, they create by-products that are not only useless\nfor the cells of the body, but could even be harmful. These waste by-\nproducts are therefore needed to be removed from the body and discarded\noutside by a process called excretion. Again, if the basic rules for body\n80 Science\nReprint 2025-26\ndesign in multi-cellular organisms are followed, a specialised tissue for\nexcretion will be developed, which means that the transportation system\nwill need to transport waste away from cells to this excretory tissue. Let us consider these various processes, so essential to maintain\nlife, one by one. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of multi-\ncellular organisms like humans?", "2. What criteria do we use to decide whether something is alive? 3. What are outside raw materials used for by an organism? 4. What processes would you consider essential for maintaining life? 55555.....22222 NNNNNUUUUUTTTTTRRRRRIIIIITTTTTIIIIIOOOOONNNNN\nWhen we walk or ride a bicycle, we are using up energy. Even when we\nare not doing any apparent activity, energy is needed to maintain a\nstate of order in our body. We also need materials from outside in order\nto grow, develop, synthesise protein and other substances needed in\nthe body. This source of energy and materials is the food we eat. How do living things get their food? The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all\norganisms, but it is fulfilled in different ways. Some organisms use simple\nfood material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon\ndioxide and water. These organisms, the autotrophs, include green\nplants and some bacteria. Other organisms utilise complex substances. These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones\nbefore they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body. To\nachieve this, organisms use bio-catalysts called enzymes. Thus, the\nheterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs. Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi. 5.2.1 Autotrophic Nutrition\nCarbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are\nfulfilled by photosynthesis. It is the process by which autotrophs take\nin substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms of\nenergy. This material is taken in the form of carbon dioxide and water\nwhich is converted into carbohydrates in the presence of sunlight and\nchlorophyll. Carbohydrates are utilised for providing energy to the plant. We will study how this takes place in the next section. The carbohydrates\nwhich are not used immediately are stored in the form of starch, which\nserves as the internal energy reserve to be used as and when required\nby the plant. A somewhat similar situation is seen in us where some of\nthe energy derived from the food we eat is stored in our body in the form\nof glycogen. Life Processes 81\nReprint 2025-26\nLet us now see what actually happens during the process of\nphotosynthesis. The following events occur during this process –\n82 Science\nNow, let us study how the plant\nobtains carbon dioxide. In Class IX,\nwe had talked about stomata (Fig. 5.3)\nwhich are tiny pores present on the\nsurface of the leaves. Massive amounts\nof gaseous exchange takes place in the\nleaves through these pores for the\npurpose of photosynthesis. But it is\nimportant to note here that exchange\nof gases occurs across the surface of\nstems, roots and leaves as well. Since\nlarge amounts of water can also be lost\nthrough these stomata, the plant FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....33333 (a) Open and (b) closed stomatal pore\ncloses these pores when it does not\nneed carbon dioxide for photosynthesis.", "The opening and closing of the\npore is a function of the guard cells. The guard cells swell when water\nflows into them, causing the stomatal pore to open. Similarly the pore\ncloses if the guard cells shrink.

Based on the two activities performed above, can we design an\nexperiment to demonstrate that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis? So far, we have talked about how autotrophs meet their energy\nrequirements. But they also need other raw materials for building their\nbody. Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the\nroots in terrestrial plants. Other materials like nitrogen, phosphorus,\niron and magnesium are taken up from the soil. Nitrogen is an essential\nelement used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds. This is\nLife Processes 83\nReprint 2025-26\ntaken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites. Or it is taken up as\norganic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from\natmospheric nitrogen. 5.2.2 Heterotrophic Nutrition\nEach organism is adapted to its environment. The form of nutrition\ndiffers depending on the type and availability of food material as well\nas how it is obtained by the organism. For example, whether the food\nsource is stationary (such as grass) or mobile (such as a deer), would\nallow for differences in how the food is accessed and what is the nutritive\napparatus used by a cow and a lion. There is a range of strategies by\nwhich the food is taken in and used by the organism. Some organisms\nbreak-down the food material outside the body and then absorb it. Examples are fungi like bread moulds, yeast and mushrooms. Others\ntake in whole material and break it down inside their bodies. What can\nbe taken in and broken down depends on the body design and\nfunctioning. Some other organisms derive nutrition from plants or\nanimals without killing them. This parasitic nutritive strategy is used\nby a wide variety of organisms like cuscuta (amar-bel), ticks, lice,\nleeches and tape-worms. 5.2.3 How do Organisms obtain their Nutrition?", "Since the food and the way it is obtained differ, the digestive system is\ndifferent in various organisms. In single-celled organisms, the food\nmay be taken in by the entire surface. But as the complexity of the\norganism increases, different parts become specialised to perform\ndifferent functions. For example, Amoeba takes in food using\ntemporary finger-like extensions of the cell surface which fuse over\nthe food particle forming a food-vacuole (Fig. 5.5). Inside the food-\nvacuole, complex substances are broken down into simpler ones\nwhich then diffuse into the cytoplasm. The remaining undigested\nmaterial is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out. In\nParamoecium, which is also a unicellular organism, the cell has a\ndefinite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot. Food is moved\nto this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface\nof the cell. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....55555 5.2.4 Nutrition in Human Beings\nNutrition in Amoeba\nThe alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth\nto the anus. In Fig. 5.6, we can see that the tube has different parts. Various regions are specialised to perform different functions. What\nhappens to the food once it enters our body? We shall discuss this\nprocess here. 84 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 55555.....33333\nn Take 1 mL starch solution (1%) in two test tubes (A and B). n Add 1 mL saliva to test tube A and leave both test tubes undisturbed\nfor 20-30 minutes. n Now add a few drops of dilute iodine solution to the test tubes. n In which test tube do you observe a colour change? n What does this indicate about the presence or absence of starch\nin the two test tubes? n What does this tell us about the action of saliva on starch? We eat various types of food which has to pass through the same\ndigestive tract. Naturally the food has to be processed to generate\nparticles which are small and of the same texture. This is achieved by\ncrushing the food with our teeth. Since the lining of the canal is soft, the\nfood is also wetted to make its passage smooth. When we eat something\nwe like, our mouth ‘waters’. This is actually not only water, but a fluid\ncalled saliva secreted by the salivary glands. Another aspect of the food\nwe ingest is its complex nature. If it is to be absorbed from the alimentary\ncanal, it has to be broken into smaller molecules. This is done with the\nhelp of biological catalysts called\nenzymes. The saliva contains an\nenzyme called salivary amylase that\nbreaks down starch which is a complex\nmolecule to give simple sugar. The food\nis mixed thoroughly with saliva and\nmoved around the mouth while\nchewing by the muscular tongue. It is necessary to move the food in\na regulated manner along the digestive\ntube so that it can be processed\nproperly in each part. The lining of\ncanal has muscles that contract\nrhythmically in order to push the food\nforward. These peristaltic movements\noccur all along the gut.", "From the mouth, the food is taken\nto the stomach through the food-pipe\nor oesophagus. The stomach is a large\norgan which expands when food\nenters it. The muscular walls of the\nstomach help in mixing the food\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....66666 Human alimentary canal\nthoroughly with more digestive juices. The digestion in stomach is taken\ncare of by the gastric glands present in the wall of the stomach. These\nrelease hydrochloric acid, a protein digesting enzyme called pepsin,\nand mucus. The hydrochloric acid creates an acidic medium which\nfacilitates the action of the enzyme pepsin. What other function do you\nthink is served by the acid? The mucus protects the inner lining of the\nstomach from the action of the acid under normal conditions. We\nLife Processes 85\nReprint 2025-26\nhave often heard adults complaining about ‘acidity’. Can this be related\nto what has been discussed above? The exit of food from the stomach is regulated by a sphincter muscle\nwhich releases it in small amounts into the small intestine. From the\nstomach, the food now enters the small intestine. This is the longest part\nof the alimentary canal which is fitted into a compact space because of\nextensive coiling. The length of the small intestine differs in various\nanimals depending on the food they eat. Herbivores eating grass need a\nlonger small intestine to allow the cellulose to be digested. Meat is easier\nto digest, hence carnivores like tigers have a shorter small intestine. The small intestine is the site of the complete digestion of\ncarbohydrates, proteins and fats. It receives the secretions of the liver\nand pancreas for this purpose. The food coming from the stomach is\nacidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act. Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats. Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes\nit difficult for enzymes to act on them. Bile salts break them down into\nsmaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action. This is similar\nto the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in\nChapter 4. The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains\nenzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down\nemulsified fats. The walls of the small intestine contain glands which\nsecrete intestinal juice. The enzymes present in it finally convert the\nproteins to amino acids, complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats\ninto fatty acids and glycerol. Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine. The inner\nlining of the small intestine has numerous finger-like projections called\nvilli which increase the surface area for absorption. The villi are richly\nsupplied with blood vessels which take the absorbed food to each and\nevery cell of the body, where it is utilised for obtaining energy, building\nup new tissues and the repair of old tissues.", "The unabsorbed food is sent into the large intestine where its wall\nabsorb more water from this material. The rest of the material is removed\nfrom the body via the anus. The exit of this waste material is regulated\nby the anal sphincter. 86 Science\n!wonK\not\neroM\nDental caries\nDental caries or tooth decay causes gradual softening of enamel and dentine.

If untreated, microorganisms may invade the pulp, causing\ninflammation and infection. Reprint 2025-26\nQ U E S T I O N S\n1.

We have discussed nutrition in organisms in the last section. The\nfood material taken in during the process of nutrition is used in cells to\nprovide energy for various life processes. Diverse organisms do this in\ndifferent ways – some use oxygen to break-down glucose completely\ninto carbon dioxide and water, some use other pathways that do not\ninvolve oxygen (Fig. 5.8). In all cases, the first step is the break-down of\nglucose, a six-carbon molecule, into a three-carbon molecule called\npyruvate. This process takes place in the cytoplasm.", "Further, the\npyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide. This process\ntakes place in yeast during fermentation. Since this process takes place\nin the absence of air (oxygen), it is called anaerobic respiration. Break-\ndown of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria. This\nLife Processes 87\nReprint 2025-26\nprocess breaks up the three-carbon pyruvate molecule to give three\nmolecules of carbon dioxide. The other product is water. Since this\nprocess takes place in the presence of air (oxygen), it is called aerobic\nrespiration. The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater\nthan in the anaerobic process. Sometimes, when there is a lack of oxygen\nin our muscle cells, another pathway for the break-down of pyruvate is\ntaken. Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a\nthree-carbon molecule. This build-up of lactic acid in our muscles during\nsudden activity causes cramps. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....88888 Break-down of glucose by various pathways\nThe energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used\nto synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other\nactivities in the cell. In these processes, ATP is broken down giving rise\nto a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions\ntaking place in the cell. ATP\nATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes. The energy released during\nthe process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic\nphosphate. Endothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions. When the\nterminal phosphate linkage in ATP is broken using water, the energy equivalent to\n30.5 kJ/mol is released. Think of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses. It can be\nused to obtain mechanical energy, light energy, electrical energy and so on. Similarly,\nATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles, protein synthesis,\nconduction of nervous impulses and many other activities. Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen, aerobic\norganisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen. We\nhave seen that plants exchange gases through stomata, and the large\ninter-cellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air. Carbon\ndioxide and oxygen are exchanged by diffusion here. They can go into\n88 Science\n!wonK\not\neroM\nReprint 2025-26\ncells, or away from them and out into the air. The direction of diffusion\ndepends upon the environmental conditions and the requirements of\nthe plant. At night, when there is no photosynthesis occurring, CO\n2\nelimination is the major exchange activity going on. During the day,\nCO generated during respiration is used up for photosynthesis, hence\n2\nthere is no CO release. Instead, oxygen release is the major event at\n2\nthis time. Animals have evolved different organs for the uptake of oxygen\nfrom the environment and for getting rid of the carbon dioxide\nproduced.", "Terrestrial animals can breathe the oxygen in the\natmosphere, but animals that live in water need to use the oxygen\ndissolved in water.

We have seen in previous sections that blood transports food, oxygen\nand waste materials in our bodies. In Class IX, we learnt about blood\nbeing a fluid connective tissue. Blood consists of a fluid medium called\nplasma in which the cells are suspended. Plasma transports food, carbon\ndioxide and nitrogenous wastes in dissolved form.

It then contracts, while the next chamber,\nthe left ventricle, relaxes, so that the blood is transferred to it. When the\nmuscular left ventricle contracts in its turn, the blood is pumped out to\nthe body. De-oxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper\nchamber on the right, the right atrium, as it relaxes. As the right atrium\ncontracts, the corresponding lower chamber, the right ventricle, dilates. This transfers blood to the right ventricle, which in turn pumps it to the\nlungs for oxygenation.

In animals that do not use energy\nfor this purpose, the body temperature depends\non the temperature in the environment.", "Such\nanimals, like amphibians or many reptiles have\nthree-chambered hearts, and tolerate some mixing\nof the oxygenated and de-oxygenated blood\nstreams. Fishes, on the other hand, have only two\nchambers to their hearts, and the blood is pumped\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....1111111111 to the gills, is oxygenated there, and passes directly\nSchematic representation of transport and exchange to the rest of the body.

This is known as double\ncirculation. 92 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nLife Processes 93\n!wonK\not\neroM\nBlood pressure\nThe force that blood exerts against the wall of a vessel is called blood pressure. This\npressure is much greater in arteries than in veins. The pressure of blood inside the\nartery during ventricular systole (contraction) is called systolic pressure and pressure\nin artery during ventricular diastole (relaxation) is called diastolic pressure. The normal\nsystolic pressure is about 120 mm of Hg and diastolic pressure is 80 mm of Hg. Blood pressure is measured with an instrument called sphygmomanometer. High\nblood pressure is also called hypertension and is caused by the constriction of\narterioles, which results in increased resistance to blood flow. It can lead to the rupture\nof an artery and internal bleeding. The tubes – blood vessels\nArteries are the vessels which carry blood away from the heart to various\norgans of the body. Since the blood emerges from the heart under high\npressure, the arteries have thick, elastic walls. Veins collect the blood\nfrom different organs and bring it back to the heart. They do not need\nthick walls because the blood is no longer under pressure, instead they\nhave valves that ensure that the blood flows only in one direction. On reaching an organ or tissue, the artery divides into smaller and\nsmaller vessels to bring the blood in contact with all the individual cells. The smallest vessels have walls which are one-cell thick and are called\ncapillaries. Exchange of material between the blood and surrounding\ncells takes place across this thin wall. The capillaries then join together\nto form veins that convey the blood away from the organ or tissue. Maintenance by platelets\nWhat happens if this system of tubes develops a leak? Think about\nsituations when we are injured and start bleeding. Naturally the loss of\nblood from the system has to be minimised. In addition, leakage would\nlead to a loss of pressure which would reduce the efficiency of the\nReprint 2025-26\npumping system. To avoid this, the blood has platelet cells which circulate\naround the body and plug these leaks by helping to clot the blood at\nthese points of injury. Lymph\nThere is another type of fluid also involved in transportation. This is\ncalled lymph or tissue fluid.", "Through the pores present in the walls of\ncapillaries some amount of plasma, proteins and blood cells escape into\nintercellular spaces in the tissues to form the tissue fluid or lymph. It is\nsimilar to the plasma of blood but colourless and contains less protein. Lymph drains into lymphatic capillaries from the intercellular spaces,\nwhich join to form large lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins. Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess\nfluid from extra cellular space back into the blood. 5.4.2 Transportation in Plants\nWe have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such\nas CO and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyll-containing\n2\norgans, namely leaves. The other kinds of raw materials needed for\nbuilding plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately. For plants,\nthe soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen,\nphosphorus and other minerals. The absorption of these substances\ntherefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil, namely roots. If the distances between soil-contacting organs and chlorophyll-\ncontaining organs are small, energy and raw materials can easily diffuse\nto all parts of the plant body. But if these distances become large because\nof changes in plant body design, diffusion processes will not be sufficient\nto provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots. A proper system of\ntransportation is therefore essential in such situations. Energy needs differ between different body designs. Plants do not\nmove, and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many\ntissues. As a result, plants have low energy needs, and can use relatively\nslow transport systems. The distances over which transport systems\nhave to operate, however, can be very large in plants such as very tall\ntrees. Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw\nmaterials from roots. These two pathways are constructed as\nindependently organised conducting tubes. One, the xylem moves water\nand minerals obtained from the soil. The other, phloem transports\nproducts of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised\nto other parts of the plant. We have studied the structure of these tissues\nin detail in Class IX. Transport of water\nIn xylem tissue, vessels and tracheids of the roots, stems and leaves are\ninterconnected to form a continuous system of water-conducting\nchannels reaching all parts of the plant. At the roots, cells in contact\nwith the soil actively take up ions. This creates a difference in the\nconcentration of these ions between the root and the soil. Water, therefore,\n94 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nmoves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference. This means\nthat there is steady movement of water into root xylem, creating a column\nof water that is steadily pushed upwards. However, this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move\nwater over the heights that we commonly see in plants.", "Plants use another\nstrategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the\nplant body. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 55555.....88888\nn Take two small pots of approximately the same size and having\nthe same amount of soil. One should have a plant in it. Place a\nstick of the same height as the plant in the other pot. n Cover the soil in both pots with a plastic sheet so that moisture\ncannot escape by evaporation. n Cover both sets, one with the plant and the other with the stick,\nwith plastic sheets and place in bright sunlight for half an hour. n Do you observe any difference in the two cases? Provided that the plant has an adequate\nsupply of water, the water which is lost through the\nstomata is replaced by water from the xylem vessels\nin the leaf. In fact, evaporation of water molecules from\nthe cells of a leaf creates a suction which pulls water\nfrom the xylem cells of roots. The loss of water in the\nform of vapour from the aerial parts of the plant is\nknown as transpiration. Thus, transpiration helps in the absorption and\nupward movement of water and minerals dissolved\nin it from roots to the leaves. It also helps in\ntemperature regulation. The effect of root pressure in\ntransport of water is more important at night. During\nthe day when the stomata are open, the transpiration\npull becomes the major driving force in the movement\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 55555.....1111122222\nof water in the xylem. Movement of water during transpiration in a tree\nTransport of food and other substances\nSo far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants. Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes, particularly\nphotosynthesis, are moved from leaves, where they are formed, to other\nparts of the plant. This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis\nis called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue\nknown as phloem. Besides the products of photosynthesis, the phloem\ntransports amino acids and other substances. These substances are\nespecially delivered to the storage organs of roots, fruits and seeds and\nto growing organs. The translocation of food and other substances takes\nplace in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both\nin upward and downward directions. Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple\nphysical forces, the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising\nLife Processes 95\nReprint 2025-26\nenergy. Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using\nenergy from ATP. This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue\ncausing water to move into it. This pressure moves the material in the\nphloem to tissues which have less pressure. This allows the phloem to\nmove material according to the plant’s needs. For example, in the spring,\nsugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds\nwhich need energy to grow. Q U E S T I O N S\n1.

Other metabolic activities\ngenerate nitrogenous materials which need to be removed. The biological\nprocess involved in the removal of these harmful metabolic wastes from\nthe body is called excretion. Different organisms use varied strategies to\ndo this. Many unicellular organisms remove these wastes by simple\ndiffusion from the body surface into the surrounding\nwater. As we have seen in other processes, complex\nmulti-cellular organisms use specialised organs to\nperform the same function. 5.5.1 Excretion in Human Beings\nThe excretory system of human beings (Fig. 5.13)\nincludes a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary\nbladder and a urethra. Kidneys are located in the\nabdomen, one on either side of the backbone. Urine\nproduced in the kidneys passes through the ureters\ninto the urinary bladder where it is stored until it is\nreleased through the urethra. How is urine produced? The purpose of making\nurine is to filter out waste products from the blood. Just as CO is removed from the blood in the lungs,\n2\nnitrogenous waste such as urea or uric acid are\nFigure 5.13 removed from blood in the kidneys. It is then no\nExcretory system in human beings\nsurprise that the basic filtration unit in the kidneys,\n96 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nlike in the lungs, is a cluster of very thin-walled blood\ncapillaries. Each capillary cluster in the kidney is\nassociated with the cup-shaped end of a coiled tube\ncalled Bowman’s capsule that collects the filtrate\n(Fig. 5.14). Each kidney has large numbers of these\nfiltration units called nephrons packed close together. Some substances in the initial filtrate, such as glucose,\namino acids, salts and a major amount of water, are\nselectively re-absorbed as the urine flows along the tube. The amount of water re-absorbed depends on how much\nexcess water there is in the body, and on how much of\ndissolved waste there is to be excreted. The urine forming\nin each kidney eventually enters a long tube, the ureter,\nwhich connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure\nof the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out\nthrough the urethra. The bladder is muscular, so it is\nunder nervous control, as we have discussed elsewhere. As a result, we can usually control the urge to urinate.

This leads to accumulation of\npoisonous wastes in the body, which can even lead to death. In case of kidney\nfailure, an artificial kidney can be used. An artificial kidney is a device to remove\nnitrogenous waste products from the blood through dialysis. Artificial kidneys contain a number of tubes with a semi-permeable lining, suspended\nin a tank filled with dialysing fluid. This fluid has the same osmotic\npressure as blood, except that it is\ndevoid of nitrogenous wastes. The\npatient’s blood is passed through\nthese tubes. During this passage,\nthe waste products from the blood\npass into dialysing fluid by diffusion. The purified blood is pumped back\ninto the patient. This is similar to the\nfunction of the kidney, but it is\ndifferent since there is no re-\nabsorption involved. Normally, in a\nhealthy adult, the initial filtrate in the\nkidneys is about 180 L daily. However, the volume actually\nexcreted is only a litre or two a day,\nbecause the remaining filtrate is re-\nabsorbed in the kidney tubules. Reprint 2025-26\n5.5.2 Excretion in Plants\nThink it over!
