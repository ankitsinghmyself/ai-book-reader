["Wave Optics\nChapter Ten\nWAVE OPTICS\n10.1 I\nNTRODUCTION\nIn 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell’s\nlaw. It explained the laws of reflection and refraction of light at an interface. The corpuscular model predicted that if the ray of light (on refraction)\nbends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the\nsecond medium. This corpuscular model of light was further developed\nby Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of\nthe tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very\noften attributed to Newton. In 1678, the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens put forward the\nwave theory of light – it is this wave model of light that we will discuss in\nthis chapter. As we will see, the wave model could satisfactorily explain\nthe phenomena of reflection and refraction; however, it predicted that on\nrefraction if the wave bends towards the normal then the speed of light\nwould be less in the second medium. This is in contradiction to the\nprediction made by using the corpuscular model of light. It was much\nlater confirmed by experiments where it was shown that the speed of\nlight in water is less than the speed in air confirming the prediction of the\nwave model; Foucault carried out this experiment in 1850. The wave theory was not readily accepted primarily because of\nNewton’s authority and also because light could travel through vacuu2m55\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nand it was felt that a wave would always require a medium to propagate\nfrom one point to the other. However, when Thomas Young performed\nhis famous interference experiment in 1801, it was firmly established\nthat light is indeed a wave phenomenon. The wavelength of visible\nlight was measured and found to be extremely small; for example, the\nwavelength of yellow light is about 0.6 mm. Because of the smallness\nof the wavelength of visible light (in comparison to the dimensions of\ntypical mirrors and lenses), light can be assumed to approximately\ntravel in straight lines. This is the field of geometrical optics, which we\nhad discussed in the previous chapter. Indeed, the branch of optics in\nwhich one completely neglects the finiteness of the wavelength is called\ngeometrical optics and a ray is defined as the path of energy\npropagation in the limit of wavelength tending to zero. After the interference experiment of Young in 1801, for the next 40\nyears or so, many experiments were carried out involving the\ninterference and diffraction of lightwaves; these experiments could only\nbe satisfactorily explained by assuming a wave model of light. Thus,\naround the middle of the nineteenth century, the wave theory seemed\nto be very well established. The only major difficulty was that since it\nwas thought that a wave required a medium for its propagation, how\ncould light waves propagate through vacuum. This was explained\nwhen Maxwell put forward his famous electromagnetic theory of light.", "Maxwell had developed a set of equations describing the laws of\nelectricity and magnetism and using these equations he derived what\nis known as the wave equation from which he predicted the existence\nof electromagnetic waves*. From the wave equation, Maxwell could\ncalculate the speed of electromagnetic waves in free space and he found\nthat the theoretical value was very close to the measured value of speed\nof light. From this, he propounded that light must be an\nelectromagnetic wave. Thus, according to Maxwell, light waves are\nassociated with changing electric and magnetic fields; changing electric\nfield produces a time and space varying magnetic field and a changing\nmagnetic field produces a time and space varying electric field. The\nchanging electric and magnetic fields result in the propagation of\nelectromagnetic waves (or light waves) even in vacuum. In this chapter we will first discuss the original formulation of the\nHuygens principle and derive the laws of reflection and refraction. In\nSections 10.4 and 10.5, we will discuss the phenomenon of interference\nwhich is based on the principle of superposition. In Section 10.6 we\nwill discuss the phenomenon of diffraction which is based on Huygens-\nFresnel principle. Finally in Section 10.7 we will discuss the\nphenomenon of polarisation which is based on the fact that the light\nwaves are transverse electromagnetic waves. * Maxwell had predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves around 1855; it\nwas much later (around 1890) that Heinrich Hertz produced radiowaves in the\nlaboratory. J.C. Bose and G. Marconi made practical applications of the Hertzian\n256\nwaves\nReprint 2025-26\nWave Optics\n10.2 H P\nUYGENS RINCIPLE\nWe would first define a wavefront: when we drop a small stone on a\ncalm pool of water, waves spread out from the point of impact. Every\npoint on the surface starts oscillating with time. At any instant, a\nphotograph of the surface would show circular rings on which the\ndisturbance is maximum. Clearly, all points on such a circle are\noscillating in phase because they are at the same distance from the\nsource. Such a locus of points, which oscillate in phase is called a\nwavefront; thus a wavefront is defined as a surface of constant\nFIGURE 10.1 (a) A\nphase. The speed with which the wavefront moves outwards from the\ndiverging spherical\nsource is called the speed of the wave. The energy of the wave travels\nwave emanating from\nin a direction perpendicular to the wavefront. a point source. The\nIf we have a point source emitting waves uniformly in all directions, wavefronts are\nthen the locus of points which have the same amplitude and vibrate in spherical. the same phase are spheres and we have what is known as a spherical\nwave as shown in Fig. 10.1(a). At a large distance from the source, a\nsmall portion of the sphere can be considered as a plane and we have\nwhat is known as a plane wave [Fig. 10.1(b)].", "Now, if we know the shape of the wavefront at t = 0, then Huygens\nprinciple allows us to determine the shape of the wavefront at a later\ntime t. Thus, Huygens principle is essentially a geometrical construction,\nwhich given the shape of the wafefront at any time allows us to determine\nthe shape of the wavefront at a later time. Let us consider a diverging\nFIGURE 10.1 (b) At a\nwave and let F F represent a portion of the spherical wavefront at t = 0\n1 2 large distance from\n(Fig. 10.2).

If we now draw\na common tangent to all these spheres, we obtain the new position of the\nwavefront at t = t. The new wavefront shown as G G in Fig. 10.2 is again\n1 2\nspherical with point O as the centre. The above model has one shortcoming: we also have a backwave which\nis shown as D D in Fig. 10.2. Huygens argued that the amplitude of the\n1 2\nsecondary wavelets is maximum in the forward direction and zero in the\nbackward direction; by making this adhoc assumption, Huygens could\nexplain the absence of the backwave. However, this adhoc assumption is\nnot satisfactory and the absence of the backwave is really justified from\nmore rigorous wave theory. In a similar manner, we can use Huygens principle to determine the\nshape of the wavefront for a plane wave propagating through a medium\n(Fig. 10.3).

If we now consider the triangles EAC and BAC we will find that they\nare congruent and therefore, the angles i and r (as shown in Fig. 10.6)\nwould be equal. This is the law of reflection. Once we have the laws of reflection and refraction, the behaviour of\nprisms, lenses, and mirrors can be understood. These phenomena were\ndiscussed in detail in Chapter 9 on the basis of rectilinear propagation of\nlight. Here we just describe the behaviour of the wavefronts as they\nundergo reflection or refraction. In Fig. 10.7(a) we consider a plane wave\npassing through a thin prism. Clearly, since the speed of light waves is\nless in glass, the lower portion of the incoming wavefront (which travels\nthrough the greatest thickness of glass) will get delayed resulting in a tilt\nin the emerging wavefront as shown in the figure. In Fig. 10.7(b) we\nconsider a plane wave incident on a thin convex lens; the central part of\nthe incident plane wave traverses the thickest portion of the lens and is\ndelayed the most. The emerging wavefront has a depression at the centre\nand therefore the wavefront becomes spherical and converges to the point\nF which is known as the focus. In Fig.", "10.7(c) a plane wave is incident on\na concave mirror and on reflection we have a spherical wave converging\nto the focal point F. In a similar manner, we can understand refraction\nand reflection by concave lenses and convex mirrors. From the above discussion it follows that the total time taken from a\npoint on the object to the corresponding point on the image is the same\nmeasured along any ray. For example, when a convex lens focusses light\nto form a real image, although the ray going through the centre traverses\na shorter path, but because of the slower speed in glass, the time taken\nis the same as for rays travelling near the edge of the lens.

You may recall\nthat we had discussed the superposition\nprinciple in Chapter 14 of your Class XI\ntextbook. Indeed the entire field of\ninterference is based on the superposition\nprinciple according to which at a particular\npoint in the medium, the resultant\ndisplacement produced by a number of\nwaves is the vector sum of the displace-\nments produced by each of the waves. Consider two needles S and S moving\n1 2\nperiodically up and down in an identical\nfashion in a trough of water [Fig. 10.8(a)]. They produce two water waves,\nand at a particular point, the phase difference between the displacements\nproduced by each of the waves does not change with time; when this\nhappens the two sources are said to be coherent. Figure 10.8(b) shows\nthe position of crests (solid circles) and troughs (dashed circles) at a given\ninstant of time. Consider a point P for which\n262\nS P = S P\n1 2\n1.01\nELPMAXE\nExample 10.1\n(a) When monochromatic light is incident on a surface separating\ntwo media, the reflected and refracted light both have the same\nfrequency as the incident frequency. Explain why? (b) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed\ndecreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the\nenergy carried by the light wave? (c) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the\nsquare of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity\nof light in the photon picture of light. Solution\n(a) Reflection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light\nwith the atomic constituents of matter. Atoms may be viewed as\noscillators, which take up the frequency of the external agency\n(light) causing forced oscillations. The frequency of light emitted by\na charged oscillator equals its frequency of oscillation. Thus, the\nfrequency of scattered light equals the frequency of incident light. (b) No. Energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the\nwave, not on the speed of wave propagation.", "(c) For a given frequency, intensity of light in the photon picture is\ndetermined by the number of photons crossing an unit area per\nunit time.

This is\nreferred to as destructive interference. To summarise: If we have two coherent sources S and S vibrating\n1 2\nin phase, then for an arbitrary point P whenever the path difference,\nS P ~ S P = nl (n = 0, 1, 2, 3,...)

Now, for any other arbitrary point G (Fig. 10.10) let the phase\ndifference between the two displacements be f. Thus, if the displacement\nproduced by S is given by\n1\ny = a cos wt\n1\nthen, the displacement produced by S would be\n2\ny = a cos (wt + f)\n2\nand the resultant displacement will be given by\ny = y + y\n1 2\n= a [cos wt + cos (wt +f)]\n= 2 a cos (f/2) cos (wt + f/2)\nThe amplitude of the resultant displacement is 2a cos (f/2) and\ntherefore the intensity at that point will be\nI = 4 I cos2 (f/2) (10.11)\n0\nIf f = 0, – 2 p, – 4 p,… which corresponds to the condition given by\nEq.

Now if the two sources are coherent (i.e., if the two needles are going\nup and down regularly) then the phase difference f at any point will not\nchange with time and we will have a stable interference pattern; i.e., the\npositions of maxima and minima will not change with time. However, if\nthe two needles do not maintain a constant phase difference, then the\ninterference pattern will also change with time and, if the phase difference\nchanges very rapidly with time, the positions of maxima and minima will\nalso vary rapidly with time and we will see a “time-averaged” intensity\ndistribution.

Even before Young,\nearly experimenters – including Newton – had noticed that light spreads\nout from narrow holes and slits. It seems to turn around corners and\nenter regions where we would expect a shadow. These effects, known as\ndiffraction, can only be properly understood using wave ideas. After all,\nyou are hardly surprised to hear sound\nwaves from someone talking around a corner! When the double slit in Young’s\nexperiment is replaced by a single narrow\nslit (illuminated by a monochromatic\nsource), a broad pattern with a central bright\nregion is seen. On both sides, there are\nalternate dark and bright regions, the\nintensity becoming weaker away from the\ncentre (Fig. 10.15). To understand this, go\nto Fig. 10.14, which shows a parallel beam\nof light falling normally on a single slit LN of\nwidth a. The diffracted light goes on to meet\nFIGURE 10.14 The geometry of path\na screen. The midpoint of the slit is M. differences for diffraction by a single slit. A straight line through M perpendicular\nto the slit plane meets the screen at C. We want the\nintensity at any point P on the screen. As before, straight\nlines joining P to the different points L,M,N, etc., can be\ntreated as parallel, making an angle q with the\nnormal MC. The basic idea is to divide the slit into much smaller\nparts, and add their contributions at P with the proper\nphase differences. We are treating different parts of the\nwavefront at the slit as secondary sources. Because the\nincoming wavefront is parallel to the plane of the slit, these\nsources are in phase. It is observed that the intensity has a central\nmaximum at q = 0 and other secondary maxima at q l\n(n+1/2) l/a, which go on becoming weaker and weaker\nwith increasing n. The minima (zero intensity) are at q l\nnl/a, n = ±1, ±2, ±3, ....

In this context, it is\ninteresting to note what Richard Feynman***** has said in his famous\nFeynman Lectures on Physics:\nNo one has ever been able to define the difference between\ninterference and diffraction satisfactorily. It is just a question\nof usage, and there is no specific, important physical difference\nbetween them. The best we can do is, roughly speaking, is to\nsay that when there are only a few sources, say two interfering\nsources, then the result is usually called interference, but if there\nis a large number of them, it seems that the word diffraction is\nmore often used. In the double-slit experiment, we must note that the pattern on the\nscreen is actually a superposition of single-slit diffraction from each slit\nor hole, and the double-slit interference pattern. 1111100000.....66666.....22222 SSSSSeeeeeeeeeeiiiiinnnnnggggg ttttthhhhheeeee sssssiiiiinnnnngggggllllleeeee sssssllllliiiiittttt dddddiiiiiffffffffffrrrrraaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnn pppppaaaaatttttttttteeeeerrrrrnnnnn\nIt is surprisingly easy to see the single-slit diffraction pattern for oneself.

Reprint 2025-26\nWave Optics\n10.7 P\nOLARISATION\nConsider holding a long string that is held horizontally, the other end of\nwhich is assumed to be fixed. If we move the end of the string up and\ndown in a periodic manner, we will generate a wave propagating in the\n+x direction (Fig. 10.17). Such a wave could be described by the following\nequation\nFIGURE 10.17 (a) The curves represent the displacement of a string at\nt = 0 and at t = Dt, respectively when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\nin the +x-direction. (b) The curve represents the time variation\nof the displacement at x = 0 when a sinusoidal wave is propagating\nin the +x-direction. At x = Dx, the time variation of the\ndisplacement will be slightly displaced to the right. y (x,t) = a sin (kx – wt) (10.15)\nwhere a and w (= 2pn) represent the amplitude and the angular frequency\nof the wave, respectively; further,\n2p\nl =\n(10.16)\nk\nrepresents the wavelength associated with the wave. We had discussed\npropagation of such waves in Chapter 14 of Class XI textbook. Since the\ndisplacement (which is along the y direction) is at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave, we have what is known as a\ntransverse wave. Also, since the displacement is in the y direction, it is\noften referred to as a y-polarised wave. Since each point on the string\nmoves on a straight line, the wave is also referred to as a linearly polarised 269\nReprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nwave. Further, the string always remains confined to the x-y plane and\ntherefore it is also referred to as a plane polarised wave. In a similar manner we can consider the vibration of the string in the\nx-z plane generating a z-polarised wave whose displacement will be given\nby\nz (x,t) = a sin (kx – wt) (10.17)\nIt should be mentioned that the linearly polarised waves [described\nby Eqs. (10.15) and (10.17)] are all transverse waves; i.e., the\ndisplacement of each point of the string is always at right angles to the\ndirection of propagation of the wave. Finally, if the plane of vibration of\nthe string is changed randomly in very short intervals of time, then we\nhave what is known as an unpolarised wave. Thus, for an unpolarised\nwave the displacement will be randomly changing with time though it\nwill always be perpendicular to the direction of propagation. Light waves are transverse in nature; i.e., the electric field associated\nwith a propagating light wave is always at right angles to the direction of\npropagation of the wave. This can be easily demonstrated using a simple\npolaroid. You must have seen thin plastic like sheets, which are called\npolaroids.", "A polaroid consists of long chain molecules aligned in a\nparticular direction. The electric vectors (associated with the propagating\nlight wave) along the direction of the aligned molecules get absorbed. Thus, if an unpolarised light wave is incident on such a polaroid then\nthe light wave will get linearly polarised with the electric vector oscillating\nalong a direction perpendicular to the aligned molecules; this direction\nis known as the pass-axis of the polaroid. Thus, if the light from an ordinary source (like a sodium lamp) passes\nthrough a polaroid sheet P it is observed that its intensity is reduced by\n1,\nhalf. Rotating P has no effect on the transmitted beam and transmitted\n1\nintensity remains constant. Now, let an identical piece of polaroid P be\n2\nplaced before P . As expected, the light from the lamp is reduced in\n1\nintensity on passing through P alone. But now rotating P has a dramatic\n2 1\neffect on the light coming from P . In one position, the intensity transmitted\n2\nby P followed by P is nearly zero. When turned by 90° from this position,\n2 1\nP transmits nearly the full intensity emerging from P (Fig. 10.18). 1 2\nThe experiment at figure 10.18 can be easily understood by assuming\nthat light passing through the polaroid P gets polarised along the pass-\n2\naxis of P . If the pass-axis of P makes an angle q with the pass-axis of\n2 2\nP , then when the polarised beam passes through the polaroid P , the\n1 2\ncomponent E cos q (along the pass-axis of P ) will pass through P . 2 2\nThus, as we rotate the polaroid P (or P ), the intensity will vary as:\n1 2\nI = I cos2q (10.18)\n0\nwhere I is the intensity of the polarized light after passing through\n0\nP .This is known as Malus’ law.

Reprint 2025-26\nPhysics\nSUMMARY\n1. Huygens’ principle tells us that each point on a wavefront is a source\nof secondary waves, which add up to give the wavefront at a later time. 2. Huygens’ construction tells us that the new wavefront is the forward\nenvelope of the secondary waves. When the speed of light is\nindependent of direction, the secondary waves are spherical. The rays\nare then perpendicular to both the wavefronts and the time of travel\nis the same measured along any ray. This principle leads to the well\nknown laws of reflection and refraction. 3. The principle of superposition of waves applies whenever two or more\nsources of light illuminate the same point. When we consider the\nintensity of light due to these sources at the given point, there is an\ninterference term in addition to the sum of the individual intensities. But this term is important only if it has a non-zero average, which\noccurs only if the sources have the same frequency and a stable phase\ndifference. 4. Young’s double slit of separation d gives equally spaced interference\nfringes. 5. A single slit of width a gives a diffraction pattern with a central\nl 2l\nmaximum. The intensity falls to zero at angles of – –, , etc.,\na a\nwith successively weaker secondary maxima in between. 6. Natural light, e.g., from the sun is unpolarised. This means the electric\nvector takes all possible directions in the transverse plane, rapidly\nand randomly, during a measurement. A polaroid transmits only one\ncomponent (parallel to a special axis). The resulting light is called\nlinearly polarised or plane polarised. When this kind of light is viewed\nthrough a second polaroid whose axis turns through 2p, two maxima\nand minima of intensity are seen. POINTS TO PONDER\n1. Waves from a point source spread out in all directions, while light was\nseen to travel along narrow rays. It required the insight and experiment\nof Huygens, Young and Fresnel to understand how a wave theory could\nexplain all aspects of the behaviour of light. 2. The crucial new feature of waves is interference of amplitudes from different\nsources which can be both constructive and destructive, as shown in\nYoung’s experiment. 3. Diffraction phenomena define the limits of ray optics. The limit of the\nability of microscopes and telescopes to distinguish very close objects is\nset by the wavelength of light. 4. Most interference and diffraction effects exist even for longitudinal waves\nlike sound in air.", "But polarisation phenomena are special to transverse\nwaves like light waves. 272\nReprint 2025-26\nWave Optics\nEXERCISES\n10.1 Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a\nwater surface.
