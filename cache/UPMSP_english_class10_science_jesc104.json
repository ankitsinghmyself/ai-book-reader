["4\nCHAPTER\nCarbon and its\nCompounds\nIn the last Chapter, we came to know many compounds of importance\nto us. In this Chapter we will study about some more interesting\ncompounds and their properties. Also, we shall be learning about carbon,\nan element which is of immense significance to us in both its elemental\nform and in the combined form.

Look at the items that come in the last column of the above table\nfilled by you – your teacher will be able to tell you that most of them are\nmade up of compounds of carbon. Can you think of a method to test\nthis? What would be the product if a compound containing carbon is\nburnt? Do you know of any test to confirm this? Food, clothes, medicines, books, or many of the things that you listed\nare all based on this versatile element carbon. In addition, all living\nstructures are carbon based. The amount of carbon present in the earth’s\ncrust and in the atmosphere is quite meagre. The earth’s crust has only\n0.02% carbon in the form of minerals (like carbonates, hydrogen-\ncarbonates, coal and petroleum) and the atmosphere has 0.03% of carbon\ndioxide. In spite of this small amount of carbon available in nature, the\nimportance of carbon seems to be immense. In this Chapter, we will know\nabout the properties of carbon which make carbon so important to us. 4.1 BONDING IN CARBON – THE COVALENT BOND\nIn the previous Chapter, we have studied the properties of ionic\ncompounds. We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling\npoints and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state. We also\n58 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nsaw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these\nproperties. Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds. Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we\nhave seen in Chapter 2. From the data\ngiven in Table 4.1 on the boiling and Table 4.1 Melting points and boiling points of some\nmelting points of the carbon compounds, compounds of carbon\nwe find that these compounds have low\nCompound Melting Boiling\nmelting and boiling points as compared\npoint (K) point (K)\nto ionic compounds (Chapter 3).

Let us now look at the electronic\nconfiguration of carbon. The atomic number of carbon is 6. What would\nbe the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon? How many\nvalence electrons will carbon have? We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency\nto attain a completely filled outer shell, that is, attain noble gas\nconfiguration. Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either\ngaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell. In the case of carbon,\nit has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four\nelectrons to attain noble gas configuration. If it were to gain or lose\nelectrons –\n(i) It could gain four electrons forming C4– anion. But it would be difficult\nfor the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons, that is,\nfour extra electrons. (ii) It could lose four electrons forming C4+ cation. But it would require\na large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a\ncarbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two\nelectrons. Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with\nother atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements. Not just carbon,\nbut many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this\nmanner. The shared electrons ‘belong’ to the outermost shells of both\nthe atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration. Before going on to compounds of carbon, let us look at some simple\nmolecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons. The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen. As you have learnt earlier, the atomic number of hydrogen is 1. Hence\nhydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron\nto fill the K shell. So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a\nmolecule of hydrogen, H . This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the\n2\nCarbon and its Compounds 59\nReprint 2025-26\nelectronic configuration of the nearest noble gas,\nhelium, which has two electrons in its K shell. We can\ndepict this using dots or crosses to represent valence\nelectrons (Fig. 4.1). The shared pair of electrons is said to constitute a\nsingle covalent bond between the two hydrogen atoms. A single covalent bond is also represented by a line\nbetween the two atoms, as shown in Fig. 4.2. FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 44444.....11111 The atomic number of chlorine is 17.

Note that\nonly the valence shell electrons need to be depicted. In the case of oxygen, we see the formation of a double bond between\ntwo oxygen atoms.", "This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons\nin its L shell (the atomic number of oxygen is eight) and it requires two\nmore electrons to complete its octet. So each atom of oxygen shares two\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 44444.....22222\nSingle bond between electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in\ntwo hydrogen atoms Fig. 4.3.

Can you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature\nof bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen\natoms? Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds?

In\norder to attain an octet, each nitrogen atom in a molecule of\nnitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared\npairs of electrons.

Let us now take a look at methane, which is a compound\nof carbon. Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major\ncomponent of bio-gas and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). It\nis also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon. Methane has a formula CH . Hydrogen, as you know, has a\n4\nvalency of 1. Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence\nelectrons.

Covalently bonded\nmolecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule, but inter-\nmolecular forces are weak. This gives rise to the low melting and boiling\n60 Science\nReprint 2025-26\npoints of these compounds. Since the electrons are shared between\natoms and no charged particles are formed, such covalent compounds\nare generally poor conductors of electricity. Allotropes of carbon\nThe element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with\nwidely varying physical properties. Both diamond and\ngraphite are formed by carbon atoms, the difference lies in\nthe manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one\nFFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 44444.....55555\nanother.

The structure of diamond The structure of C-60\nBuckminsterfullerene\nThese two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different\nphysical properties even though their chemical properties are the same. Diamond is\nthe hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery. Graphite is also\na very good conductor of electricity unlike other non-metals that you studied in the\nprevious Chapter. Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and\ntemperature. These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable\nfrom natural diamonds. Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes. The first one to be identified was\nC-60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football. Since this looked\nlike the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller, the molecule\nwas named fullerene. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1.

We have also seen the\nstructure of a simple carbon compound, methane. In the beginning\nof the Chapter, we saw how many things we use contain carbon. In\nfact, we ourselves are made up of carbon compounds. The numbers\nof carbon compounds whose formulae are known to chemists was\nrecently estimated to be in millions! This outnumbers by a large\nmargin the compounds formed by all the other elements put together. Why is it that this property is seen in carbon and no other element? The nature of the covalent bond enables carbon to form a large number\nof compounds. Two factors noticed in the case of carbon are –\n(i) Carbon has the unique ability to form bonds with other atoms of\ncarbon, giving rise to large molecules. This property is called\ncatenation. These compounds may have long chains of carbon,\nbranched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings. In addition, carbon atoms may be linked by single, double or triple\nbonds. Compounds of carbon, which are linked by only single\nbonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds. Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their\ncarbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds. No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent\nseen in carbon compounds.", "Silicon forms compounds with\nhydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms, but these\ncompounds are very reactive. The carbon-carbon bond is very strong\nand hence stable. This gives us the large number of compounds\nwith many carbon atoms linked to each other. (ii) Since carbon has a valency of four, it is capable of bonding with\nfour other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other mono-valent\nelement. Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen, hydrogen,\nnitrogen, sulphur, chlorine and many other elements giving rise to\ncompounds with specific properties which depend on the elements\nother than carbon present in the molecule. Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are\nvery strong making these compounds exceptionally stable. One\nreason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size. This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons\nstrongly. The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are\nmuch weaker. 62 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nOrganic compounds\nThe two characteristic features seen in carbon, that is, tetravalency and catenation, put\ntogether give rise to a large number of compounds. Many have the same non-carbon\natom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains. These compounds were\ninitially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon\ncompounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system. That is,\nit was postulated that a ‘vital force’ was necessary for their synthesis. Friedrich Wöhler\ndisproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate. But carbon\ncompounds, except for carbides, oxides of carbon, carbonate and hydrogencarbonate\nsalts continue to be studied under organic chemistry. 44444.....22222.....11111 SSSSSaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrraaaaattttteeeeeddddd aaaaannnnnddddd UUUUUnnnnnsssssaaaaatttttuuuuurrrrraaaaattttteeeeeddddd CCCCCaaaaarrrrrbbbbbooooonnnnn CCCCCooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss\nWe have already seen the structure of methane. Another compound\nformed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C H . 2 6\nIn order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon\ncompounds, the first step is to link the carbon atoms\ntogether with a single bond (Fig. 4.6a) and then use the\nhydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon\n(Fig. 4.6b).

How can this molecule be depicted? We follow\n2 4\nthe same step-wise approach as above. Carbon-carbon atoms linked together with a single bond (Step 1). We see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied\n(Step 2). This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the\ntwo carbons (Step 3).

FFFFFiiiiiggggguuuuurrrrreeeee 44444.....77777\nStructure of ethene 4.2.2 Chains, Branches and Rings\nIn the earlier section, we mentioned the carbon compounds methane,\nethane and propane, containing respectively 1, 2 and 3 carbon atoms. Such ‘chains’ of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms. The names and structures of six of these are given in Table 4.2.

Such\n4 10\ncompounds with identical molecular formula but different structures\nare called structural isomers.

Among these, the saturated\nhydrocarbons are called alkanes. The unsaturated hydrocarbons which\ncontain one or more double bonds are called alkenes. Those containing\none or more triple bonds are called alkynes. 4.2.3 Will you be my Friend? Carbon seems to be a very friendly element. So far we have been looking at\ncompounds containing carbon and hydrogen only. But carbon also forms\nCarbon and its Compounds 65\nReprint 2025-26\nbonds with other elements such as halogens, oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur. In a hydrocarbon chain, one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these\nelements, such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied. In such\ncompounds, the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom. These heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 4.3. These heteroatoms and\nTable 4.3 Some functional groups in carbon compounds\nthe group containing\nthese confer specific\nHHHHHeeeeettttteeeeerrrrrooooo CCCCClllllaaaaassssssssss ooooofffff FFFFFooooorrrrrmmmmmuuuuulllllaaaaa ooooofffff\nproperties to the\naaaaatttttooooommmmm cccccooooommmmmpppppooooouuuuunnnnndddddsssss fffffuuuuunnnnnccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnaaaaalllll gggggrrrrrooooouuuuuppppp\ncompound, regardless\nof the length and nature\nCl/Br Halo- (Chloro/bromo) —Cl, —Br\nof the carbon chain and\nalkane (substitutes for\nhence are called\nhydrogen atom)\nfunctional groups.

The functional group\nis attached to the carbon\n3. Ketone\nchain through this\nvalency by replacing one\nhydrogen atom or\n4.

In addition,\nhydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced\nby any of the functional groups that we saw above. The presence of a\nfunctional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon\ncompound, regardless of the length of the carbon chain. For example,\nthe chemical properties of CH OH, C H OH, C H OH and C H OH are all\n3 2 5 3 7 4 9\nvery similar. Hence, such a series of compounds in which the same\nfunctional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a\nhomologous series. Let us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table\n4.2. If we look at the formulae of successive compounds, say –\nCH and C H — these differ by a –CH - unit\n4 2 6 2\nC H and C H — these differ by a –CH - unit\n2 6 3 8 2\nWhat is the difference between the next pair – propane and butane (C H )?", "4 10\nCan you find out the difference in molecular masses between these\npairs (the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen\nis 1 u)? Similarly, take the homologous series for alkenes. The first member\nof the series is ethene which we have already come across in\nSection 4.2.1. What is the formula for ethene? The succeeding members\nhave the formula C H , C H and C H . Do these also differ by a –CH –\n3 6 4 8 5 10 2\n66 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nunit? Do you see any relation between the number of carbon and\nhydrogen atoms in these compounds? The general formula for alkenes\ncan be written as C H , where n = 2, 3, 4. Can you similarly generate the\nn 2n\ngeneral formula for alkanes and alkynes? As the molecular mass increases in any homologous series, a\ngradation in physical properties is seen. This is because the melting and\nboiling points increase with increasing molecular mass. Other physical\nproperties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar\ngradation. But the chemical properties, which are determined solely by\nthe functional group, remain similar in a homologous series.

Can we call this family a homologous series? n Generate the homologous series for compounds containing up to\nfour carbons for the other functional groups given in Table 4.3. 4.2.5 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds\nThe names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name\nof the basic carbon chain modified by a “prefix” “phrase before” or “suffix”\n“phrase after” indicating the nature of the functional group. For example,\nthe names of the alcohols taken in Activity 4.2 are methanol, ethanol,\npropanol and butanol. Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method –\n(i) Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound. A compound\nhaving three carbon atoms would have the name propane. (ii) In case a functional group is present, it is indicated in the\nname of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix (as given\nin Table 4.4). (iii) If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix, and the\nsuffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a, e, i, o, u, then\nthe name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final ‘e’ and\nadding the appropriate suffix. For example, a three-carbon chain\nwith a ketone group would be named in the following manner –\nPropane – ‘e’ = propan + ‘one’ = propanone. (iv) If the carbon chain is unsaturated, then the final ‘ane’ in the name\nof the carbon chain is substituted by ‘ene’ or ‘yne’ as given in\nTable 4.4. For example, a three-carbon chain with a double bond\nwould be called propene and if it has a triple bond, it would be\ncalled propyne.", "Carbon and its Compounds 67\nReprint 2025-26\nTable 4.4 Nomenclature of organic compounds\nClass of Prefix/Suffix Example\ncompounds\n1.

Have you ever observed either a coal or a wood fire? If not, the next time you get a\nchance, take close note of what happens when the wood or coal starts to burn. You\nhave seen above that a candle or the LPG in the gas stove burns with a flame. However,\nyou will observe the coal or charcoal in an ‘angithi’ sometimes just glows red and\ngives out heat without a flame. This is because a flame is only produced when gaseous\nsubstances burn. When wood or charcoal is ignited, the volatile substances present\nvapourise and burn with a flame in the beginning. A luminous flame is seen when the atoms of the gaseous substance are heated and\nstart to glow. The colour produced by each element is a characteristic property of\nthat element. Try and heat a copper wire in the flame of a gas stove and observe its\ncolour. You have seen that incomplete combustion gives soot which is carbon. On\nthis basis, what will you attribute the yellow colour of a candle flame to? Formation of coal and petroleum\nCoal and petroleum have been formed from biomass which has been subjected to\nvarious biological and geological processes. Coal is the remains of trees, ferns, and\nother plants that lived millions of years ago. These were crushed into the earth,\nperhaps by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. They were pressed down by layers of\nearth and rock. They slowly decayed into coal. Oil and gas are the remains of millions\nof tiny plants and animals that lived in the sea. When they died, their bodies sank to\nthe sea bed and were covered by silt. Bacteria attacked the dead remains, turning\nthem into oil and gas under the high pressures they were being subjected to. Meanwhile, the silt was slowly compressed into rock. The oil and gas seeped into the\nporous parts of the rock, and got trapped like water in a sponge. Can you guess why\ncoal and petroleum are called fossil fuels? 4.3.2 Oxidation\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 44444.....55555 You have learnt\nabout oxidation reactions in\nn Take about 3 mL of ethanol in a test tube and warm it the first Chapter.

These substances are known as oxidising agents. Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate\nare oxidising alcohols to acids, that is, adding oxygen to the starting\nmaterial. Hence they are known as oxidising agents. 4.3.3 Addition Reaction\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts\nsuch as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons. Catalysts\nare substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different\nrate without the reaction itself being affected. This reaction is commonly\nused in the hydrogenation of vegetable oils using a nickel catalyst. Vegetable oils generally have long unsaturated carbon chains while\nanimal fats have saturated carbon chains. You must have seen advertisements stating that some vegetable oils\nare ‘healthy’. Animal fats generally contain saturated fatty acids which\nare said to be harmful for health. Oils containing unsaturated fatty acids\nshould be chosen for cooking. 4.3.4 Substitution Reaction\nSaturated hydrocarbons are fairly unreactive and are inert in the presence\nof most reagents. However, in the presence of sunlight, chlorine is added\nto hydrocarbons in a very fast reaction. Chlorine can replace the hydrogen\natoms one by one. It is called a substitution reaction because one type\nof atom or a group of atoms takes the place of another. A number of\nproducts are usually formed with the higher homologues of alkanes.

But here we shall study\nthe properties of two commercially important compounds – ethanol and\nethanoic acid. Carbon and its Compounds 71\nReprint 2025-26\n4.4.1 Properties of Ethanol\nEthanol is a liquid at room temperature (refer to Table 4.1 for the melting\nand boiling points of ethanol). Ethanol is commonly called alcohol and\nis the active ingredient of all alcoholic drinks. In addition, because it is a\ngood solvent, it is also used in medicines such as tincture iodine, cough\nsyrups, and many tonics. Ethanol is also soluble in water in all\nproportions. Consumption of small quantities of dilute ethanol causes\ndrunkenness. Even though this practice is condemned, it is a socially\nwidespread practice. However, intake of even a small quantity of pure\nethanol (called absolute alcohol) can be lethal. Also, long-term\nconsumption of alcohol leads to many health problems.", "RRRRReeeeeaaaaaccccctttttiiiiiooooonnnnnsssss ooooofffff EEEEEttttthhhhhaaaaannnnnooooolllll\n(i) Reaction with sodium –\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 44444.....66666\n2Na + 2CH CH OH → 2CH CH O–Na+ + H\n3 2 3 2 2\nTeacher’s demonstration – (Sodium ethoxide)\nn Drop a small piece of sodium,\nAlcohols react with sodium leading to the\nabout the size of a couple of\nevolution of hydrogen.

How do alcohols affect living beings? When large quantities of ethanol are consumed, it tends to slow metabolic processes\nand to depress the central nervous system. This results in lack of coordination,\nmental confusion, drowsiness, lowering of the normal inhibitions, and finally stupor. The individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement, sense\nof timing, and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired. Unlike ethanol, intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death. Methanol\nis oxidised to methanal in the liver. Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of\ncells. It coagulates the protoplasm, in much the same way an egg is coagulated by\ncooking. Methanol also affects the optic nerve, causing blindness. Ethanol is an important industrial solvent. To prevent the misuse of ethanol produced\nfor industrial use, it is made unfit for drinking by adding poisonous substances\nlike methanol to it. Dyes are also added to colour the alcohol blue so that it can be\nidentified easily. This is called denatured alcohol. 72 Science\n?wonK\nuoY\noD\nReprint 2025-26\nAlcohol as a fuel\nSugarcane plants are one of the most efficient convertors of sunlight into chemical\nenergy. Sugarcane juice can be used to prepare molasses which is fermented to give\nalcohol (ethanol). Some countries now use alcohol as an additive in petrol since it is a\ncleaner fuel which gives rise to only carbon dioxide and water on burning in sufficient\nair (oxygen). 4.4.2 Properties of Ethanoic Acid\nEthanoic acid is commonly called acetic acid and\nAAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 44444.....77777\nbelongs to a group of acids called carboxylic\nacids. 5-8% solution of acetic acid in water is\nn Compare the pH of dilute acetic acid\ncalled vinegar and is used widely as a preservative\nand dilute hydrochloric acid using\nin pickles.

Reactions of ethanoic acid:\n(i) Esterification reaction: Esters are most commonly\nformed by reaction of an acid and an alcohol. Ethanoic acid reacts with absolute ethanol in the\npresence of an acid catalyst to give an ester –\nFigure 4.11\nAcid Formation of ester\nCH COOHCH CH OH CH COCCH CH H O\n3 3 2 3 2 3 2\nO\n(Etthanoic acid) (Ethanol) (Ester)\nGenerally, esters are sweet-smelling substances. These are used in\nmaking perfumes and as flavouring agents. On treating with sodium\nhydroxide, which is an alkali, the ester is converted back to alcohol\nand sodium salt of carboxylic acid.

Does the oil layer separate out? Formation of micelles In which test tube does this happen first? 74 Science\nReprint 2025-26\nThis activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning. Most dirt is\noily in nature and as you know, oil does not dissolve in water. The\nmolecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain carboxylic\nacids. The ionic-end of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain\ninteracts with oil. The soap molecules, thus form structures called\nmicelles (see Fig. 4.12) where one end of the molecules is towards the oil\ndroplet while the ionic-end faces outside. This forms an emulsion in\nwater. The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and\nwe can wash our clothes clean (Fig. 4.13). Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if\nyou dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon? Micelles\nSoaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties, one is hydrophilic,\nthat is, it interacts with water, while the other end is hydrophobic, that is, it interacts\nwith hydrocarbons. When soap is at the surface of water, the hydrophobic ‘tail’ of soap\nwill not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the\nionic end in water and the hydrocarbon ‘tail’ protruding out of water. Inside water,\nthese molecules have a unique orientation that keeps\nthe hydrocarbon portion out of the water. Thus,\nclusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails\nare in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends\nare on the surface of the cluster. This formation is\ncalled a micelle. Soap in the form of a micelle is able\nto clean, since the oily dirt will be collected in the\ncentre of the micelle. The micelles stay in solution as\na colloid and will not come together to precipitate\nbecause of ion-ion repulsion. Thus, the dirt\nsuspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away. The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light. Hence a soap solution appears cloudy.

Note for the teacher: If hard water is not available in your locality,\nprepare some hard water by dissolving hydrogencarbonates/\nsulphates/chlorides of calcium or magnesium in water. AAAAAccccctttttiiiiivvvvviiiiitttttyyyyy 44444.....1111122222\nn Take two test tubes with about 10 mL of hard water in each. n Add five drops of soap solution to one and five drops of detergent\nsolution to the other. n Shake both test tubes for the same period. n Do both test tubes have the same amount of foam? n In which test tube is a curdy solid formed? Have you ever observed while bathing that foam is formed with\ndifficulty and an insoluble substance (scum) remains after washing with\nwater? This is caused by the reaction of soap with the calcium and\nmagnesium salts, which cause the hardness of water. Hence you need\nto use a larger amount of soap. This problem is overcome by using\nanother class of compounds called detergents as cleansing agents. Detergents are generally sodium salts of sulphonic acids or ammonium\nsalts with chlorides or bromides ions, etc. Both have long hydrocarbon\nchain. The charged ends of these compounds do not form insoluble\nprecipitates with the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water. Thus,\nthey remain effective in hard water. Detergents are usually used to make\nshampoos and products for cleaning clothes. Q U E S T I O N S\n? 1. Would you be able to check if water is hard by using a detergent? 2.
