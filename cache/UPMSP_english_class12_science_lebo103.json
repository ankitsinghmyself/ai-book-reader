Now, let’s discuss a closely related\nBirth Control\ntopic – reproductive health. What do we understand by\n3.3 Medical Termination of this term? The term simply refers to healthy reproductive\nPregnancy organs with normal functions. However, it has a broader\nperspective and includes the emotional and social aspects\n3.4 Sexually Transmitted\nof reproduction also. According to the World Health\nDiseases Organisation (WHO), reproductive health means a total\nwell-being in all aspects of reproduction, i.e., physical,\n3.5 Infertility\nemotional, behavioural and social. Therefore, a society with\npeople having physically and functionally normal\nreproductive organs and normal emotional and behavioural\ninteractions among them in all sex-related aspects might\nbe called reproductively healthy. Why is it significant to\nmaintain reproductive health and what are the methods\ntaken up to achieve it? Let us examine them. 3.1 R H – P\nEPRODUCTIVE EALTH ROBLEMS AND\nS\nTRATEGIES\nIndia was amongst the first countries in the world to\ninitiate action plans and programmes at a national level\nto attain total reproductive health as a social goal. These programmes called ‘family planning’ were\ninitiated in 1951 and were periodically assessed over\nthe past decades. Improved programmes covering wider\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nreproduction-related areas are currently in operation under the\npopular name ‘Reproductive and Child Health Care (RCH) programmes’. Creating awareness among people about various reproduction related\naspects and providing facilities and support for building up a\nreproductively healthy society are the major tasks under these\nprogrammes. With the help of audio-visual and the print-media governmental and\nnon-governmental agencies have taken various steps to create awareness\namong the people about reproduction-related aspects. Parents, other\nclose relatives, teachers and friends, also have a major role in the\ndissemination of the above information. Introduction of sex education\nin schools should also be encouraged to provide right information to\nthe young so as to discourage children from believing in myths and\nhaving misconceptions about sex-related aspects. Proper information\nabout reproductive organs, adolescence and related changes, safe and\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted diseases (STD), AIDS,\netc., would help people, especially those in the adolescent age group to\nlead a reproductively healthy life.", "Educating people, especially fertile\ncouples and those in marriageable age group, about available birth\ncontrol options, care of pregnant mothers, post-natal care of the mother\nand child, importance of breast feeding, equal opportunities for the male\nand the female child, etc., would address the importance of bringing up\nsocially conscious healthy families of desired size. Awareness of problems\ndue to uncontrolled population growth, social evils like sex-abuse and\nsex-related crimes, etc., need to be created to enable people to think\nand take up necessary steps to prevent them and thereby build up a\nsocially responsible and healthy society. Successful implementation of various action plans to attain\nreproductive health requires strong infrastructural facilities, professional\nexpertise and material support. These are essential to provide medical\nassistance and care to people in reproduction-related problems like\npregnancy, delivery, STDs, abortions, contraception, menstrual problems,\ninfertility, etc. Implementation of better techniques and new strategies\nfrom time to time are also required to provide more efficient care\nand assistance to people. Statutory ban on amniocentesis for\nsex-determination to legally check increasing menace of female foeticides,\nmassive child immunisation, etc., are some programmes that merit\nmention in this connection. In aminocentesis some of the amniotic fluid\nof the developing foetus is taken to analyse the fetal cells and dissolved\nsubstances. This procedure is used to test for the presence of certain\n42\ngenetic disorders such as, down syndrome, haemoplilia, sickle-cell\nanemia, etc., determine the survivability of the foetus. Research on various reproduction-related areas are encouraged and\nsupported by governmental and non-governmental agencies to find out\nnew methods and/or to improve upon the existing ones. Do you know\nthat ‘Saheli’–a new oral contraceptive for the females–was developed\nReprint 2025-26\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nby scientists at Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) in Lucknow, India? Better awareness about sex related matters, increased number of medically\nassisted deliveries and better post-natal care leading to decreased maternal\nand infant mortality rates, increased number of couples with small\nfamilies, better detection and cure of STDs and overall increased medical\nfacilities for all sex-related problems, etc. all indicate improved reproductive\nhealth of the society. 3.2 P S B C\nOPULATION TABILISATION AND IRTH ONTROL\nIn the last century an all-round development in various fields significantly\nimproved the quality of life of the people. However, increased health\nfacilities along with better living conditions had an explosive impact on\nthe growth of population. The world population which was around\n2 billion (2000 million) in 1900 rocketed to about 6 billion by 2000 and\n7.2 billion in 2011. A similar trend was observed in India too.", "Our\npopulation which was approximately 350 million at the time of our\nindependence reached close to the billion mark by 2000 and crossed\n1.2 billion in May 2011. A rapid decline in death rate, maternal mortality\nrate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR) as well as an increase in\nnumber of people in reproducible age are probable reasons for this. Through our Reproductive Child Health (RCH) programme, though we\ncould bring down the population growth rate, it was only marginal. According to the 2011 census report, the population growth rate was\nless than 2 per cent, i.e., 20/1000/year, a rate at which our population\ncould increase rapidly. Such an alarming growth rate could lead to an\nabsolute scarcity of even the basic requirements, i.e., food, shelter and\nclothing, in spite of significant progress made in those areas. Therefore,\nthe government was forced to take up serious measures to check this\npopulation growth rate. The most important step to overcome this problem is to motivate smaller\nfamilies by using various contraceptive methods. You might have seen\nadvertisements in the media as well as posters/bills, etc., showing a happy\ncouple with two children with a slogan Hum Do Hamare Do (we two, our\ntwo). Many couples, mostly the young, urban, working ones have even\nadopted an ‘one child norm’. Statutory raising of marriageable age of the\nfemale to 18 years and that of males to 21 years, and incentives given to\ncouples with small families are two of the other measures taken to tackle\nthis problem. Let us describe some of the commonly used contraceptive\nmethods, which help prevent unwanted pregnancies. An ideal contraceptive should be user-friendly, easily available, 43\neffective and reversible with no or least side-effects. It also should in no\nway interfere with the sexual drive, desire and/or the sexual act of the\nuser. A wide range of contraceptive methods are presently available which\ncould be broadly grouped into the following categories, namely\nNatural/Traditional, Barrier, IUDs, Oral contraceptives, Injectables,\nImplants and Surgical methods. Reprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nNatural methods work on the principle of avoiding chances of ovum\nand sperms meeting. Periodic abstinence is one such method in which\nthe couples avoid or abstain from coitus from day 10 to 17 of the menstrual\ncycle when ovulation could be expected. As chances of fertilisation are\nvery high during this period, it is called the fertile period. Therefore, by\nabstaining from coitus during this period, conception could\nbe prevented. Withdrawal or coitus interruptus is another\nmethod in which the male partner withdraws his penis from\nthe vagina just before ejaculation so as to avoid\ninsemination. Lactational amenorrhea (absence of\nFigure 3.1(a) Condom for male\nmenstruation) method is based on the fact that ovulation\nand therefore the cycle do not occur during the period of\nintense lactation following parturition.", "Therefore, as long\nas the mother breast-feeds the child fully, chances of\nconception are almost nil. However, this method has been\nreported to be effective only upto a maximum period of six\nmonths following parturition. As no medicines or devices\nare used in these methods, side effects are almost nil. Chances of failure, though, of this method are also high. Figure 3.1(b) Condom for female In barrier methods, ovum and sperms are prevented\nfrom physically meeting with the help of barriers. Such\nmethods are available for both males and females. Condoms (Figure 3.1 a, b) are barriers made of thin rubber/\nlatex sheath that are used to cover the penis in the male or\nvagina and cervix in the female, just before coitus so that\nthe ejaculated semen would not enter into the female\nreproductive tract. This can prevent conception. ‘Nirodh’ is\na popular brand of condom for the male. Use of condoms\nhas increased in recent years due to its additional benefit of\nprotecting the user from contracting STIs and AIDS. Both\nthe male and the female condoms are disposable, can be\nself-inserted and thereby gives privacy to the user. Diaphragms, cervical caps and vaults are also barriers\nmade of rubber that are inserted into the female reproductive\ntract to cover the cervix during coitus. They prevent\nconception by blocking the entry of sperms through the\ncervix. They are reusable. Spermicidal creams, jellies and\nfoams are usually used alongwith these barriers to increase\nFigure 3.2. Copper T (CuT) their contraceptive efficiency. Another effective and popular method is the use of Intra Uterine\n44\nDevices (IUDs). These devices are inserted by doctors or expert nurses\nin the uterus through vagina. These Intra Uterine Devices are presently\navailable as the non-medicated IUDs (e.g., Lippes loop), copper releasing\nIUDs (CuT, Cu7, Multiload 375) and the hormone releasing IUDs\n(Progestasert, LNG-20) (Figure 3.2). IUDs increase phagocytosis of sperms\nwithin the uterus and the Cu ions released suppress sperm motility and\nthe fertilising capacity of sperms. The hormone releasing IUDs, in addition,\nReprint 2025-26\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nmake the uterus unsuitable for implantation and the\ncervix hostile to the sperms. IUDs are ideal contraceptives\nfor the females who want to delay pregnancy and/or space\nchildren. It is one of most widely accepted methods of\ncontraception in India. Oral administration of small doses of either progestogens\nor progestogen–estrogen combinations is another\ncontraceptive method used by the females. They are used\nin the form of tablets and hence are popularly called the\npills. Pills have to be taken daily for a period of 21 days\nstarting preferably within the first five days of menstrual Figure 3.3 Implants\ncycle. After a gap of 7 days (during which menstruation\noccurs) it has to be repeated in the same pattern till the female desires to\nprevent conception.", "They inhibit ovulation and implantation as well as\nalter the quality of cervical mucus to prevent/retard entry of sperms. Pills\nare very effective with lesser side effects and are well accepted by the females. Saheli –the new oral contraceptive for the females contains a non-steroidal\npreparation. It is a ‘once a week’ pill with very few side effects and high\ncontraceptive value. Progestogens alone or in combination with estrogen can also be used\nby females as injections or implants under the skin (Figure 3.3). Their\nmode of action is similar to that of pills and their effective periods are\nmuch longer. Administration of progestogens or progestogen-estrogen\ncombinations or IUDs within 72 hours of coitus have been found to be\nvery effective as emergency contraceptives as they could be used to avoid\npossible pregnancy due to rape or casual unprotected intercourse. Surgical methods, also called sterilisation, are generally advised for\nthe male/female partner as a terminal method to prevent any more\n45\nFigure 3.4 (a) Vasectomy\nFigure 3.4 (b) Tubectomy\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\npregnancies.

MTPs are also essential in\ncertain cases where continuation of the pregnancy could be harmful or\neven fatal either to the mother or to the foetus or both. MTPs are considered relatively safe during the first trimester, i.e., upto\n46 12 weeks of pregnancy. Second trimester abortions are much more riskier. One disturbing trend observed is that a majority of the MTPs are performed\nillegally by unqualified quacks which are not only unsafe but could be\nfatal too. Another dangerous trend is the misuse of amniocentesis to\ndetermine the sex of the unborn child. Frequently, if the foetus is found\nto be female, it is followed by MTP- this is totally against what is legal. Reprint 2025-26\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nSuch practices should be avoided because these are dangerous both for\nthe young mother and the foetus. Effective counselling on the need to\navoid unprotected coitus and the risk factors involved in illegal abortions\nas well as providing more health care facilities could reverse the mentioned\nunhealthy trend. 3.4 S T I (STI )\nEXUALLY RANSMITTED NFECTIONS S\nInfections or diseases which are transmitted through sexual intercourse\nare collectively called sexually transmitted infections (STI) or venereal\ndiseases (VD) or reproductive tract infections (RTI). Gonorrhoea, syphilis,\ngenital herpes, chlamydiasis, genital warts, trichomoniasis, hepatitis-B\nand of course, the most discussed infection in the recent years, HIV leading\nto AIDS are some of the common STIs. Among these, HIV infection is\nmost dangerous and is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.", "Some of these infections like hepatitis–B and HIV can also be\ntransmitted by sharing of injection needles, surgical instruments, etc.,\nwith infected persons, transfusion of blood, or from an infected mother to\nthe foetus too. Except for hepatitis-B, genital herpes and HIV infections,\nother diseases are completely curable if detected early and treated\nproperly. Early symptoms of most of these are minor and include itching,\nfluid discharge, slight pain, swellings, etc., in the genital region. Infected\nfemales may often be asymptomatic and hence, may remain undetected\nfor long. Absence or less significant symptoms in the early stages of\ninfection and the social stigma attached to the STIs, deter the infected\npersons from going for timely detection and proper treatment. This could\nlead to complications later, which include pelvic inflammatory diseases\n(PID), abortions, still births, ectopic pregnancies, infertility or even cancer\nof the reproductive tract. STIs are a major threat to a healthy society. Therefore, prevention or early detection and cure of these diseases are\ngiven prime consideration under the reproductive health-care\nprogrammes. Though all persons are vulnerable to these infections, their\nincidences are reported to be very high among persons in the age group\nof 15-24 years – the age group to which you also belong. There is no\nreason to panic because prevention is possible. One could be free of these\ninfections by following the simple principles given below:\n(i) Avoid sex with unknown partners/multiple partners. (ii) Always try to use condoms during coitus. (iii) In case of doubt, one should go to a qualified doctor for early\ndetection and get complete treatment if diagnosed with infection. 47\n3.5 I\nNFERTILITY\nA discussion on reproductive health is incomplete without a mention of\ninfertility. A large number of couples all over the world including India\nare infertile, i.e., they are unable to produce children inspite of unprotected\nReprint 2025-26\nBIOLOGY\nsexual co-habitation. The reasons for this could be many–physical,\ncongenital, diseases, drugs, immunological or even psychological. In India, often the female is blamed for the couple being childless, but\nmore often than not, the problem lies in the male partner. Specialised\nhealth care units (infertility clinics, etc.) could help in diagnosis and\ncorrective treatment of some of these disorders and enable these couples to\nhave children. However, where such corrections are not possible, the couples\ncould be assisted to have children through certain special techniques\ncommonly known as assisted reproductive technologies (ART). In vitro fertilisation (IVF–fertilisation outside the body in almost\nsimilar conditions as that in the body) followed by embryo transfer (ET)\nis one of such methods.", "In this method, popularly known as test tube\nbaby programme, ova from the wife/donor (female) and sperms from the\nhusband/donor (male) are collected and are induced to form zygote under\nsimulated conditions in the laboratory. The zygote or early embryos (with\nupto 8 blastomeres) could then be transferred into the fallopian tube\n(ZIFT–zygote intra fallopian transfer) and embryos with more than\n8 blastomeres, into the uterus (IUT – intra uterine transfer), to complete\nits further development. Embryos formed by in-vivo fertilisation (fusion\nof gametes within the female) also could be used for such transfer to assist\nthose females who cannot conceive. Transfer of an ovum collected from a donor into the fallopian tube\n(GIFT – gamete intra fallopian transfer) of another female who cannot\nproduce one, but can provide suitable environment for fertilisation and\nfurther development is another method attempted. Intra cytoplasmic\nsperm injection (ICSI) is another specialised procedure to form an embryo\nin the laboratory in which a sperm is directly injected into the ovum. Infertility cases either due to inability of the male partner to inseminate\nthe female or due to very low sperm counts in the ejaculates, could be\ncorrected by artificial insemination (AI) technique. In this technique,\nthe semen collected either from the husband or a healthy donor is artificially\nintroduced either into the vagina or into the uterus (IUI – intra-uterine\ninsemination) of the female. Though options are many, all these techniques require extremely high\nprecision handling by specialised professionals and expensive\ninstrumentation. Therefore, these facilities are presently available only in\nvery few centres in the country. Obviously their benefits is affordable to\n48\nonly a limited number of people. Emotional, religious and social factors\nare also deterrents in the adoption of these methods. Since the ultimate\naim of all these procedures is to have children, in India we have so many\norphaned and destitute children, who would probably not survive till\nmaturity, unless taken care of. Our laws permit legal adoption and it is\nas yet, one of the best methods for couples looking for parenthood. Reprint 2025-26\nREPRODUCTIVE HEALTH\nSUMMARY\nReproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of\nreproduction, i.e., physical, emotional, behavioural and social. Our\nnation was the first nation in the world to initiate various action plans\nat national level towards attaining a reproductively healthy society. Counselling and creating awareness among people about\nreproductive organs, adolescence and associated changes, safe and\nhygienic sexual practices, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)\nincluding AIDS, etc., is the primary step towards reproductive health.", "Providing medical facilities and care to the problems like menstrual\nirregularities, pregnancy related aspects, delivery, medical termination\nof pregnancy, STIs, birth control, infertility, post natal child and\nmaternal management is another important aspect of the Reproductive\nand Child Health Care programmes. An overall improvement in reproductive health has taken place in\nour country as indicated by reduced maternal and infant mortality\nrates, early detection and cure of STIs, assistance to infertile couples,\netc. Improved health facilities and better living conditions promoted an\nexplosive growth of population. Such a growth necessitated intense\npropagation of contraceptive methods. Various contraceptive options\nare available now such as natural, traditional, barrier, IUDs, pills,\ninjectables, implants and surgical methods. Though contraceptives are\nnot regular requirements for reproductive health, one is forced to use\nthem to avoid pregnancy or to delay or space pregnancy. Medical termination of pregnancy is legalised in our country. MTP is\ngenerally performed to get rid of unwanted pregnancy due to rapes, casual\nrelationship, etc., as also in cases when the continuation of pregnancy\ncould be harmful or even fatal to either the mother, or the foetus or both. Infections or diseases transmitted through sexual intercourse are\ncalled Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STIs). Pelvic Inflammatory\nDiseases (PIDs), still birth, infertility are some of the complications of\nthem. Early detection facilitate better cure of these diseases. Avoiding\nsexual intercourse with unknown/multiple partners, use of condoms\nduring coitus are some of the simple precautions to avoid contracting\nSTIs. Inability to conceive or produce children even after 2 years of 49\nunprotected sexual cohabitation is called infertility. Various methods\nare now available to help such couples. In Vitro fertilisation followed by\ntransfer of embryo into the female genital tract is one such method and\nis commonly known as the ‘Test Tube Baby’ Programme.
