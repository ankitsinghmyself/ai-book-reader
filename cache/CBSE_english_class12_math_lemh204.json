In Mathematics alone each generation\nv\nbuilds a new story to the old structure. – HERMAN HANKEL\n10.1 Introduction\nIn our day to day life, we come across many queries such\nas – What is your height? How should a football player hit\nthe ball to give a pass to another player of his team? Observe\nthat a possible answer to the first query may be 1.6 meters,\na quantity that involves only one value (magnitude) which\nis a real number. Such quantities are called scalars. However, an answer to the second query is a quantity (called\nforce) which involves muscular strength (magnitude) and\ndirection (in which another player is positioned). Such\nquantities are called vectors. In mathematics, physics and\nengineering, we frequently come across with both types of\nW.R. Hamilton\nquantities, namely, scalar quantities such as length, mass,\n(1805-1865)\ntime, distance, speed, area, volume, temperature, work,\nmoney, voltage, density, resistance etc. and vector quantities like displacement, velocity,\nacceleration, force, weight, momentum, electric field intensity etc. In this chapter, we will study some of the basic concepts about vectors, various\noperations on vectors, and their algebraic and geometric properties. These two type of\nproperties, when considered together give a full realisation to the concept of vectors,\nand lead to their vital applicability in various areas as mentioned above. 10.2 Some Basic Concepts\nLet ‘l’ be any straight line in plane or three dimensional space. This line can be given\ntwo directions by means of arrowheads. A line with one of these directions prescribed\nis called a directed line (Fig 10.1 (i), (ii)). Reprint 2025-26\nVECTOR ALGEBRA 339\nFig 10.1\nNow observe that if we restrict the line l to the line segment AB, then a magnitude\nis prescribed on the line l with one of the two directions, so that we obtain a directed\nline segment (Fig 10.1(iii)). Thus, a directed line segment has magnitude as well as\ndirection. Definition 1 A quantity that has magnitude as well as direction is called a vector. Notice that a directed line segment is a vector (Fig 10.1(iii)), denoted as or\nsimply as , and read as ‘vector ’ or ‘vector ’. The point A from where the vector starts is called its initial point, and the\npoint B where it ends is called its terminal point. The distance between initial and\nterminal points of a vector is called the magnitude (or length) of the vector, denoted as\n| |, or | |, or a. The arrow indicates the direction of the vector. A\nNote Since the length is never negative, the notation | | < 0 has no meaning. Position Vector\nFrom Class XI, recall the three dimensional right handed rectangular coordinate system\n(Fig 10.2(i)). Consider a point P in space, having coordinates (x, y, z) with respect to\nthe origin O(0, 0, 0).", "Then, the vector having O and P as its initial and terminal\npoints, respectively, is called the position vector of the point P with respect\nto O. Using distance formula (from Class XI), the magnitude of (or ) is given by\n| |= x2 + y2 +z2\nIn practice, the position vectors of points A, B, C, etc., with respect to the origin O\nare denoted by , , , etc., respectively (Fig 10.2 (ii)). Reprint 2025-26\n340 MATHEMATICS\nFig 10.2\nDirection Cosines\nConsider the position vector of a point P(x, y, z) as in Fig 10.3. The angles α,\nβ, γ made by the vector with the positive directions of x, y and z-axes respectively,\nare called its direction angles. The cosine values of these angles, i.e., cosα, cosβ and\ncosγ are called direction cosines of the vector , and usually denoted by l, m and n,\nrespectively. Z\nC\nPP((xx,,yy,,zz))\nz\nr\ng\nb y\nO a Y\nB\nP\nx\nA\nO a\n90°\nX\nA\nFig 10.3 X\nFrom Fig 10.3, one may note that the triangle OAP is right angled, and in it, we\nhave . Similarly, from the right angled triangles OBP and\ny z\nOCP, we may write cosβ= and cosγ= . Thus, the coordinates of the point P may\nr r\nalso be expressed as (lr, mr,nr). The numbers lr, mr and nr, proportional to the direction\ncosines are called as direction ratios of vector , and denoted as a, b and c, respectively. Reprint 2025-26\nVECTOR ALGEBRA 341\nA\nNote One may note that l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 but a2 + b2 + c2 ≠ 1, in general. 10.3 Types of Vectors\nZero Vector A vector whose initial and terminal points coincide, is called a zero vector\n(or null vector), and denoted as . Zero vector can not be assigned a definite direction\nas it has zero magnitude. Or, alternatively otherwise, it may be regarded as having any\ndirection. The vectors represent the zero vector,\nUnit Vector A vector whose magnitude is unity (i.e., 1 unit) is called a unit vector. The\nunit vector in the direction of a given vector is denoted by aˆ. Coinitial Vectors Two or more vectors having the same initial point are called coinitial\nvectors. Collinear Vectors Two or more vectors are said to be collinear if they are parallel to\nthe same line, irrespective of their magnitudes and directions. Equal Vectors Two vectors are said to be equal, if they have the same\nmagnitude and direction regardless of the positions of their initial points, and written\nas . Negative of a Vector A vector whose magnitude is the same as that of a given vector\n(say, ), but direction is opposite to that of it, is called negative of the given vector. For example, vector is negative of the vector , and written as = – . Remark The vectors defined above are such that any of them may be subject to its\nparallel displacement without changing its magnitude and direction. Such vectors are\ncalled free vectors. Throughout this chapter, we will be dealing with free vectors only. Example 1 Represent graphically a displacement\nof 40 km, 30° west of south. Solution The vector represents the required\ndisplacement (Fig 10.4).

Now consider a situation that a girl\nmoves from A to B and then from B to C\n(Fig 10.7). The net displacement made by the girl from\npoint A to the point C, is given by the vector and\nFig 10.7\nexpressed as\n=\nThis is known as the triangle law of vector addition. In general, if we have two vectors and (Fig 10.8 (i)), then to add them, they are\npositioned so that the initial point of one coincides with the terminal point of the other\n(Fig 10.8(ii)).

Now, consider a boat in a river going from one bank of the river to the other in a\ndirection perpendicular to the flow of the river. Then, it is acted upon by two velocity\nvectors–one is the velocity imparted to the boat by its engine and other one is the\nvelocity of the flow of river water.", "Under the simultaneous influence of these two\nvelocities, the boat in actual starts travelling with a different velocity. To have a precise\nidea about the effective speed and direction\n(i.e., the resultant velocity) of the boat, we have\nthe following law of vector addition. If we have two vectors represented\nby the two adjacent sides of a parallelogram\nin magnitude and direction (Fig 10.9), then their\nsum is represented in magnitude and\ndirection by the diagonal of the parallelogram\nthrough their common point. This is known as\nFig 10.9\nthe parallelogram law of vector addition. A\nNote F rom Fig 10.9, using the triangle law, one may note that\n=\nor = (since )\nwhich is parallelogram law. Thus, we may say that the two laws of vector\naddition are equivalent to each other.

Note that for any vector a, we have\n=\nHere, the zero vector is called the additive identity for the vector addition. 10.5 Multiplication of a Vector by a Scalar\nLet be a given vector and λ a scalar. Then the product of the vector by the scalar\nλ, denoted as λ , is called the multiplication of vector by the scalar λ. Note that, λ\nis also a vector, collinear to the vector . The vector λ has the direction same (or\nopposite) to that of vector according as the value of λ is positive (or negative). Also,\nthe magnitude of vector λ is |λ| times the magnitude of the vector , i.e.,\n|λ | =|λ|| |\nA geometric visualisation of multiplication of a vector by a scalar is given\nin Fig 10.12. a\na 2\n2 –\na 1 a 1 a\n2 2\nFig 10.12\nWhen λ = –1, then λ = – , which is a vector having magnitude equal to the\nmagnitude of and direction opposite to that of the direction of .

Let P be the foot of the perpendicular from P on the plane XOY. 1\nFig 10.14\nWe, thus, see that P P is parallel to z-axis. As iˆ, ˆj and kˆ are the unit vectors along the\n1\nx, y and z-axes, respectively, and by the definition of the coordinates of P, we have\n. Similarly, and .

An other algebraic\noperation which we intend to discuss regarding vectors is their product. We may\nrecall that product of two numbers is a number, product of two matrices is again a\nmatrix. But in case of functions, we may multiply them in two ways, namely,\nmultiplication of two functions pointwise and composition of two functions. Similarly,\nmultiplication of two vectors is also defined in two ways, namely, scalar (or dot)\nproduct where the result is a scalar, and vector (or cross) product where the\nresult is a vector. Based upon these two types of products for vectors, they have\nfound various applications in geometry, mechanics and engineering. In this section,\nwe will discuss these two types of products. 10.6.1 Scalar (or dot) product of two vectors\nDefinition 2 The scalar product of two nonzero vectors , denoted by , is\nReprint 2025-26\n356 MATHEMATICS\ndefined as =\nwhere, θ is the angle between (Fig 10.19).

The germinal ideas of modern vector theory date from around 1800\nwhen Caspar Wessel (1745-1818) and Jean Robert Argand (1768-1822) described\nthat how a complex number a + ib could be given a geometric interpretation with\nthe help of a directed line segment in a coordinate plane. William Rowen Hamilton\n(1805-1865) an Irish mathematician was the first to use the term vector for a\ndirected line segment in his book Lectures on Quaternions (1853). Hamilton’s\nmethod of quaternions (an ordered set of four real numbers given as:\na+biˆ +cˆj+dkˆ ,iˆ, ˆj, kˆ following certain algebraic rules) was a solution to the\nproblem of multiplying vectors in three dimensional space. Though, we must\nmention here that in practice, the idea of vector concept and their addition was\nknown much earlier ever since the time of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.), a Greek\nphilosopher, and pupil of Plato (427-348 B.C.). That time it was supposed to be\nknown that the combined action of two or more forces could be seen by adding\nthem according to parallelogram law. The correct law for the composition of\nforces, that forces add vectorially, had been discovered in the case of perpendicular\nforces by Stevin-Simon (1548-1620). In 1586 A.D., he analysed the principle of\ngeometric addition of forces in his treatise DeBeghinselen der Weeghconst\n(“Principles of the Art of Weighing”), which caused a major breakthrough in the\ndevelopment of mechanics. But it took another 200 years for the general concept\nof vectors to form. In the 1880, Josaih Willard Gibbs (1839-1903), an American physicist and\nmathematician, and Oliver Heaviside (1850-1925), an English engineer, created\nwhat we now know as vector analysis, essentially by separating the real (scalar)\nReprint 2025-26\n376 MATHEMATICS\npart of quaternion from its imaginary (vector) part. In 1881 and 1884, Gibbs\nprinted a treatise entitled Element of Vector Analysis. This book gave a systematic\nand concise account of vectors. However, much of the credit for demonstrating\nthe applications of vectors is due to the D. Heaviside and P.G. Tait (1831-1901)\nwho contributed significantly to this subject. —vvvvv—\nReprint 2025-26"]
